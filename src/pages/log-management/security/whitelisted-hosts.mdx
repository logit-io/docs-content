# How to ensure only whitelisted hosts can send logs

### Why you may want to only allow whitelisted hosts to send logs

Enabling only whitelisted hosts to send logs provides a higher level of 
security and control over the logging environment. This is because reducing 
log transmission to whitelisted hosts only reduces the available attack surface. 

Additionally, another option to provide further security over your logging 
environment is to establish [Logstash firewall configurations](/log-management/ingestion-pipeline/configuration/configure-logstash-firewall). 
This allows you to manage and restrict which IP addresses can 
send data to your stacks and which ports those restrictions apply to. 

This ensures that only trusted and approved devices or systems can 
send logs, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or potential 
security breaches. Also, in regulated industries or environments with 
strict compliance requirements, enabling only whitelisted hosts to 
transmit logs aids in meeting regulatory standards.

### Whitelisted Hosts Sending Logs

To ensure authentication, when using an input such as Beats-SSL, 
we recommend checking that you have IP whitelisting enabled. Having 
this enabled will guarantee that only whitelisted hosts can 
send logs via any of the inputs.
