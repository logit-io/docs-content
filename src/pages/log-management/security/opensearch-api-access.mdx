# How to access my stack via the OpenSearch API?

Although we recommend using OpenSearch Dashboards to view the data in your stacks, 
you can access your stacks using the OpenSearch API with your OpenSearch 
access details. Logit.io offers two methods of accessing your OpenSearch API, 
basic authentication mode and API key authentication mode.

### How to find your OpenSearch access details

1. Login to your Logit.io account.
2. Select Settings for the stack you wish to access.
3. Choose OpenSearch Settings from the menu.
4. Your OpenSearch access details are displayed.

### Using API key authentication mode to access OpenSearch API

This is the default method of accessing your OpenSearch API. The access
details provide you with the information required to access your stack:

You can create your web request in the following format:

```cmd copy
[ELASTICSEARCHENDPOINT]/_search?apikey=[YOURAPIKEY]&pretty=true&q=[QUERY] 
```

*Example CURL command:*

```cmd copy
curl -i -X GET "https://e6db21bb-daa8-4f06-990f-46e54fc119f3-es.logit.io/_search?apikey=e5d65acc-972a-44c1-ad42-688dfca27a04ae&pretty=true&q=[QUERY]"
```

### Using basic authentication mode to access OpenSearch API

The OpenSearch access details provide you with the information required to access your stack:

You will need to encode your username and password to base64encoding. 
A REST client can generate this for you using your credentials.

*Example CURL command:*

```cmd copy
curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization:Basic [BASE64ENCODEDCREDENTIALS]" "https:///e6db21bb-daa8-4f06-990f-46e54fc119f3-es.logit.io/_search?q=[QUERY]"
```
