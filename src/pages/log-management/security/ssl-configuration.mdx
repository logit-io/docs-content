# How to update your SSL configuration for Elastic Beats and Rsyslog

**To view the SSL Certificate Expiry Notice it can be found [here.](/log-management/security/ssl-certificate-expiry-notice)**

The [updated certificate file](https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt?_gl=1*6mao2j*_ga*NzE2MTk2MzcxLjE3MTAyNDM2MTA.*_ga_W546BZYLYM*MTcxODI4NzM3MS4xMTIuMS4xNzE4MjkwMDA5LjU3LjAuMA..) contains 
both the old and new root certificates and should be updated as soon as possible, 
if you have any issues with the new certificate, please contact us.

## Rsyslog
If you're not sending over an encrypted connection no changes are required, but we would urge you to upgrade to a TLS endpoint.

Look for the double @@ before the logstash address to confirm.

Sample configuration snippet:

```plaintext copy
$DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt

$ActionSendStreamDriver gtls
$ActionSendStreamDriverMode 1
$ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode x509/name
$ActionSendStreamDriverPermittedPeer *.logit.io

*.* @@YOUR-LOGSTASH-ENDPOINT:YOUR-SYSLOG-SSL-PORT
```

Rsyslog will only accept a single file name to verify the SSL connection 
with, but you can have more than one certificate in that file.

Replace the certificate file with a new file available from [here](https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt?_gl=1*14o90h8*_ga*NzE2MTk2MzcxLjE3MTAyNDM2MTA.*_ga_W546BZYLYM*MTcxODI4NzM3MS4xMTIuMS4xNzE4MjkwMTk2LjYwLjAuMA..)

Restart rsyslog and confirm it's reconnected and still sending data and reporting no errors.

## Legacy Filebeat / Metricbeat / Other Elastic Beats 
With older configurations (typically v1.3 or below) you may have specified a `certificate_authority` 
and will need to update the intermediate.crt on your system, see below and example:

```yml copy
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["YOUR-LOGSTASH-ENDPOINT:YOUR-BEATS-SSL-PORT"]

  tls:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/root.logit.io.crt']
    enabled: true
```

Please [download](https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt?_gl=1*1wwfhtn*_ga*NzE2MTk2MzcxLjE3MTAyNDM2MTA.*_ga_W546BZYLYM*MTcxODI4NzM3MS4xMTIuMS4xNzE4MjkwMTk2LjYwLjAuMA..) the 
new certificate and replace the old intermediate.crt. 

Newer configurations that do not specify a certificate_authority are unlikely to 
require configuration changes, however you may need to add our intermediate to 
your certificate store as per your OS defaults, see below for an example which requires no action:

```yml copy
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["YOUR-LOGSTASH-ENDPOINT:YOUR-BEATS-SSL-PORT"]
  ssl.enabled: true
```
