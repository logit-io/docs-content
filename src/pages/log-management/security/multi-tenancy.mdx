# Managing OpenSearch Dashboards Multi-Tenancy

## OpenSearch Tenants Introduction

OpenSearch Security Multi-Tenancy allows you to maintain separate spaces 
for working with indexes, visualisations, dashboards and other OpenSearch objects. 

By default, all OpenSearch users have access to two tenants; Global, which is 
shared by all users and Private which can't be shared and is only available privately to a single user.

You can use Tenants to securely share and collaborate with other Logit.io users. 
By controlling which roles have access to which tenants allows you to define 
granular read or write access to dashboards, visualisations and more.

You may want to share a single corporate dashboard only with members of 
the management team by defining a corporate tenant, which is then applied 
to an associated role to restrict access as needed.

## Creating a Tenant

Creating a Tenant requires a Stack Administrator role, from the 
Security Menu choose **Tenants > Create Tenant.**

You can view and switch which Tenant you are currently viewing using the 
menu in the top-right menu of OpenSearch, below we are viewing the Global Tenant.

From the Tenants screen above you can choose View Dashboards or View Visualisations 
to switch to that Tenant, in addition to duplicating and deleting existing Tenants. 

## How to restrict a user's access to a specific Tenant using Roles

Once the Tenant is created, choose **Security > Roles** and select the required Role. 
Now choose **Edit Role** and under Tenant permissions enter the name of your Tenant, 
give Read or Write permissions as required and choose **Update** to apply the changes.

If you need to create a new role to save time you can duplicate an existing role, 
for example, the *stack_user* role and choose **Actions > Duplicate.** 
This allows you to then edit the duplicated role and just modify index 
and tenant permissions where needed.

<Callout type="info">
  In most cases, any new roles will need to have read access to the 
  following indexes to allow the OpenSearch Discover view to work 
  as expected: `.kibana` `.kibana-6` .kibana_*.

By restricting the Role to a single Tenant and setting this as read-only, 
any users in that role are prevented from accessing the Global Tenant.

![Select Tenant](@/images/help/log-management/storage/select-tenant.png)

Users in these restricted roles will need to choose from the Custom 
Tenant dropdown to access only what they are authorised to.
