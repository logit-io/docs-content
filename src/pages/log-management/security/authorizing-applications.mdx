# How to ensure that only authorised applications can send logs to Logstash

Sending data to Logstash is quick and simple to set up. 
If you have not already done so, please check out 
our [Filebeat data source integration guide](/integrations/filebeat) before 
learning how to properly use the API key.

Adding security measures to safe-guard Logstash is highly recommended. 
There are a number of ways to add an authentication step to your request 
pipeline so that only authorised sources may ship logs to Logstash.

### 1. Add an API Key to every message

Sending the API key with each message is the most common and preferred way of authorising requests. 
This API key can be anything you like (such as a GUID or a special string value of your choice). 
Then you can use a Logstash filter to check if this key is included. If it is not included, 
you can drop the message as part of the filtering process. This method gives you far greater 
control over both ends of the authentication process.

For example, you can use Filebeat to send a log message that includes the API key:

```yml copy
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: filestream
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - /var/log/nginx/access.log
    fields:
      type: nginx-access
      logstashApiKey: <your-api-key>
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      exclude_files: [".gz"]
```


And use a Logstash filter to drop all messages that do not match the expected API key value:

```ruby copy

```ruby copy
if [logstashApiKey] != "<your-api-key>" 
{ 
  drop {} 
}
```


### 2. Firewall Configuration / IP White-listing

The Logit.io platform provides [Logstash Firewall Groups](/log-management/ingestion-pipeline/configuration/configure-logstash-firewall) that 
allow you to manage and restrict which IP addresses can send data to your 
stacks and which ports those restrictions apply to. Setting Firewall Groups 
improves stack security by blocking all unauthorised traffic to ports you've specified.
