# Understanding UDP

The two most common network transmission protocols are 
TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol).

TCP is often used for traffic where guaranteed delivery is 
more important than the speed of delivery and includes protocols 
to confirm that traffic has been delivered or not. Examples 
include HTTP and most non-live streaming traffic.

UDP doesn't offer the same delivery guarantees and is often used 
in situations where speed of delivery is more important than being 
able to retry a failed delivery. Examples include VOIP traffic where 
minimising the latency is more important, or DNS traffic where 
minimising the overhead is valuable.

## What are there risks to sending logs via UDP? 

UDP can offer faster delivery due to the reduced overhead and may be a 
reasonable choice for transferring logs over a local network where packet loss is unlikely. 

On a large/global network like the internet, some/occasional packet loss 
can reasonably be expected. This may result in logs failing to be 
delivered to your stack successfully.

## Why is UDP even supported then?

UDP support for shipping logs is largely there for legacy reasons. We would 
advise a customer to choose an encrypted log shipping method whenever possible.
