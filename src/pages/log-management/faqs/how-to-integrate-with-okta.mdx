# How To Set Up Integration With Okta

## Getting Started with Okta Integration on Logit.io

Integrating Okta with your Logit.io account streamlines user authentication 
and access control. Within this help article, we will guide you through the 
process of setting up an Okta Integration. Enabling Okta for Logit.io involves 
configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) between Okta and Logit.io.

SSO is available to all customers. There is however a charge depending on the 
account size .If you don't already have SSO enabled on your Logit.io account 
then please speak to your account representative or email [sales@logit.io](mailto:sales@logit.io) for more information.
Here are the steps you need to follow to enable Okta once SSO is enabled for your account:

**Log in to Okta:** Make sure you have administrative access to your Okta account. Log in to your Okta organization.

**Add Logit.io as an Application:** From the Okta Admin Dashboard, click on "Applications" and then "Applications" again. Click on the "Add Application" button. Choose a Sign-On Method: You can either select "Create New App" and choose the "SAML 2.0" Sign-On method, or search for "Logit.io" and choose the Logit.io app if it's available in the Okta Integration Network.

**Configure SAML settings:** Configure the SAML settings for Logit.io. You'll need to enter some details like the Entity ID and ACS URL. These details will be provided by Logit.io, so you may need to contact our support or documentation for this information.

**Assign Users and Groups:** In Okta, assign the appropriate users and groups to the Logit.io application. This determines who has access to Logit.io through Okta.

**Test the Configuration:** Before making the configuration live, it's a good practice to test it. You can do this by creating a user or group in Okta and verifying that SSO works as expected for Logit.io.

**Complete Logit.io Configuration:** Ensure in the Logit.io account that SAML-based SSO is configured. Please speak to your account representative or email [sales@logit.io](mailto:sales@logit.io) for more information if you are unsure.

**Test and Troubleshoot:** After completing the configuration on both Okta and Logit.io, test the SSO again. If you encounter any issues, consult the error messages and logs, and make sure the settings on both sides match.

**Roll Out to All Users:** Once you are confident that SSO is working correctly, you can roll it out to all users who need access to Logit.io.
