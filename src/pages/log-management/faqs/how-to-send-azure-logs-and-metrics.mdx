# Sending Azure Logs to Logit.io

Logit.io has a vast range of source integrations available to you. 
If you wish to see the full list, you can view 
all [Source Integrations](/integrations). 

Within this article, we will break down the various Azure source integrations 
that you can implement in Logit.io. You will need to utilize Logstash 
for some of these configurations. To locate Logstash inputs, go to 
`Logstash Inputs` settings and then click _Add New Input_, and you'll 
arrive at the page shown in the image below. Here you can choose to 
add Logstash inputs for multiple Azure Event Hubs.

Your Logstash input supports multiple event hubs. The connection string 
details can be found under Azure Portal, then Event Hub, and 
under this, you will find Shared access policies.

<Callout type="info">
  You are encouraged to create a separate consumer group specifically for 
  Logstash and not to reuse any default or existing groups. A blob storage 
  account is used to preserve the state across Logstash reboots.
</Callout>

To start sending logs from any Azure Event Hub to your stack, you 
need to submit an Azure input to Logit.io. Our engineers will 
verify your input before it is applied. This should be actioned 
in less than 24 hours, and we will contact you to verify.

There is also a broad range of Azure integrations available through 
the Logit.io platform. The full list of integrations and 
configurations is listed below.

## An Overview of Logit.io's Azure Integrations

Logit.io provides 6 [log management integration guides](/integrations) 
and 3 [infrastructure metrics integration guides](/integrations/azure/#metrics) for Azure. 

This article explains each of these in more detail below, where you can 
follow the simple steps for each integration to effectively implement 
your source integration and start sending logs and metrics.

### 1. Azure Activity Logs

Metricbeat is a nimble data collector designed to facilitate the monitoring 
of Azure Kubernetes Service. It achieves this by gathering essential 
metrics from the containers operating on the host system. 
This [configuration](/integrations/azure-kubernetes/#metrics) will 
enable Metricbeat to efficiently harvest Azure Kubernetes Service 
metrics and statistics, and seamlessly forward them to 
either Logstash or Elasticsearch.

### 2. Azure Kubernetes Metrics

Metricbeat is designed to facilitate your Azure Kubernetes Service 
monitoring efforts. This [integration](/integrations/azure-kubernetes/#metrics) achieves 
this by gathering crucial metrics from the containers operating on the host system. 
You can configure Metricbeat with the provided predefined examples, allowing you 
to gather and transmit metrics and statistics from Azure Kubernetes Service to Logit.io.

### 3. Azure Eventhub Diagnostic Logs

Azure Event Hub is a high-capacity data streaming and ingestion platform that can 
process millions of events per second, necessitating a dedicated log management 
service for effective event transformation and real-time log analysis. 

Azure's disaster recovery capabilities are renowned for their cross-compatibility 
across different operating systems, regions, and languages, with customizable 
backup schedules and [integration](/integrations/azure-eventhub-diagnostics) with 
the Logit.io platform for enhanced data protection and version control. 

Pulling diagnostic logs from Azure Event Hub to Logstash is straightforward. 
The full configuration guide can be found in our extensive source 
integrations, [Azure Event Hub Diagnostic Logs](/integrations/azure-eventhub-diagnostics).

### 4. Azure Kubernetes Logs

Filebeat, a lightweight log shipper, simplifies the process of monitoring 
Azure Kubernetes Service. It achieves this by harvesting logs from the 
containers operating on the host system. By following 
the [predefined examples](/integrations/azure-kubernetes-logs), you 
can configure Filebeat to gather and transmit Azure Kubernetes logs to Logit.io.

### 5. Azure Logs

Azure Event Hub is a powerful platform designed for streaming and ingesting large 
volumes of data. With the ability to process millions of events per second, it's 
crucial to have a reliable log management service to efficiently transform and 
monitor these events for comprehensive log message analysis. Our platform offers 
automated parsing through robust and highly available Logstash pipelines, 
facilitating a swift [migration](/integrations) of your log data.

### 6. Azure SQL

Experience enhanced data management with our Azure SQL Database integration. 
Logit.io connects with your Azure SQL Database, providing you with powerful 
data analysis and monitoring capabilities. 

With our [Azure SQL integration guide](/integrations/azure-sql), 
you can easily monitor your database's performance and security in real-time, 
enabling data-driven decision-making. Logit.io simplifies the process, 
so you can focus on gaining valuable insights from your data.

### 7. Azure AKS Metrics

Optimize your Azure AKS Cluster with Logit.io integration. Connect your 
cluster to Logit.io's platform for enhanced monitoring and analysis. 
Our [Azure AKS metrics integration guide](/integrations/azure-aks-metrics/#metrics) 
provides real-time visibility into your containerized applications and microservices, 
helping you manage and troubleshoot effectively. Keep a close eye on performance 
and security, and leverage the benefits of Logit.io to streamline your 
AKS Cluster operations.

### 8. Azure Container Activity Logs

Simplify your Azure Container Activity Log Management with Logit.io's integration. 
Connect your logs to our platform for comprehensive analysis. 
Our [Azure container activity logs integration guide](/integrations/azure-container-activity-logs/#metrics) 
provides real-time insights into container activities, enabling you to efficiently 
monitor performance, security, and compliance. Logit.io streamlines your 
monitoring process, allowing you to make the most of your Azure Container Activity Logs.

### 9. Azure Metrics

Unlock the power of the [Azure Metrics integration](/integrations/azure-metrics/#metrics) with 
Logit.io. Monitor essential services and resources, customize dashboards, 
and leverage anomaly detection to optimize performance. Logit.io streamlines 
integration for comprehensive data analysis, enabling you to enhance your 
cloud monitoring capabilities and maintain a secure and efficient cloud infrastructure.
