# How to enable Kibana Multi-Stack

## Kibana Multi-Stack

Enabling Kibana multi-stack functionality allows you to manage and visualize 
data from multiple Elasticsearch clusters using a single Kibana instance. 

This is particularly effective for multiple situations, one of these being for 
centralized monitoring and analysis. If you have multiple Elasticsearch clusters 
spread across different environments, regions, or departments, Kibana multi-stack 
enables you to access and analyze the data from all these clusters in a unified manner. 

This centralization facilitates comprehensive monitoring and analysis without 
needing separate Kibana instances for each cluster.

  Multi-stack is now enabled by default for all new stacks, so 
  you may not need to enable this feature depending on your stack version.
</Callout>

Another scenario when you may want to enable Kibana multi-stack is for reduced 
overhead and complexity. Instead of managing separate Kibana instances for each 
Elasticsearch cluster, enabling the multi-stack feature simplifies administration 
by reducing the overhead of multiple installations and configurations. It streamlines 
the management process, making it easier to maintain and operate.

## Enabling Kibana Multi-Stack

Kibana multi-stack is now enabled by default for new stacks, but for existing or 
older customers you will have to manually enable this. To enable Kibana multi-stack, 
from any of your Logit.io stacks, select settings. Then from settings, 
select Kibana settings, here you can enable Kibana multi-stack.
