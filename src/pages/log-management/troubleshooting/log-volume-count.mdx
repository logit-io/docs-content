You can view the number of logs used today and their volume. To find your 
log volume count, navigate to the 'Logs Count' section where you can view 
the number of logs used for a given time period. For the time period, you 
can select either 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days or 365 days.
