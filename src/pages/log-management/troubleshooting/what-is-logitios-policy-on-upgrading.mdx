# What is Logit.io's policy on upgrading ELK?

Logit.io's policy is that we do not upgrade your stack automatically to the 
latest ELK version, however, you can request an in-place upgrade to the latest 
version where the existing stack ID is retained and the data is migrated by 
Logit.io into the upgraded stack. If you wish to choose this option 
please contact us [here](https://logit.io/about-us/contact-us/).
