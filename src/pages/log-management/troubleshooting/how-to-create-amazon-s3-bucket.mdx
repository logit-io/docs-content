# How to create an Amazon S3 bucket and send data to Logit.io

Logit.io provides extensive features and configurations to 
ingest, monitor, and analyze data sent to an Amazon S3 bucket!

Follow this quickstart guide to send data from an S3 bucket to Logit.io. 

## Pre-requisites

You'll need a Logit.io account. Sign up for a free trial [here](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-up).

## Step 1: Creating an S3 Bucket

Go to the AWS Amazon S3 website using the following link: [https://aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

From here click the "Get Started with Amazon S3" button.

![Amazon S3](@/images/help/getting-started/amazon-s3.png)

If you already have an AWS Account then sign in. Otherwise click the 
"Create a new AWS account" button, create a new account and then follow the steps below.

You will be taken to the S3 Get Started page as there are currently 
no existing Buckets. Click on the "Create Bucket" button to go to the Create Bucket page.

![Amazon S3 Create Bucket](@/images/help/getting-started/amazon-s3-create-bucket.png)

In this example we will leave the everything on the page as the 
default and simply add our new bucket name as shown below:

![AWS Create Bucket](@/images/help/getting-started/aws-create-bucket.png)

Copy the name you have given to the bucket as we will require this later 
and then scroll down to the very bottom of the page and click the "Create bucket" button.

![Create Bucket](@/images/help/getting-started/create-bucket.png)

You will then be taken to the S3 Buckets page and will see the newly created bucket.

## Step 2: Upload logs to the bucket

<Callout type="info">
  Copy and paste the bucket name and the region name to a text editor of your 
  choice as they are needed to fill in further Amazon forms and the Logit.io Inputs form.
</Callout>

The region is highlighted in blue above. Click on the link 
to the new bucket as shown highlighted in red.

This takes you to the overview page for the Bucket, from here we can 
also look at properties, permissions, metrics etc but in this example 
we will just upload some logs, this is done by pressing either of the two "Upload" buttons.

![Logit Test Bucket](@/images/help/getting-started/logit-test-bucket.png)

This will take us to the file upload page, here we need to click "Add files". 
If you have a log file that you wish to use then browse to the file and upload it.

![Logit Add Files](@/images/help/getting-started/add-files.png)

If you want to just get an example file with some logs for 
now you can go to the following 
URL: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=problems-example-log-file](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=problems-example-log-file) and copy some example logs from there:

![RSVP Agent Processing Log](@/images/help/getting-started/rsvp-agent-processing-log.png)

Copy this and paste it into a text editor of your choice. Save 
the file with any name that you want such as test.txt and then 
click "Add files" as shown in the previous screenshot.

Navigate to the file you have just created and select it. You 
should now see that the file has been added.

![Files and Folders](@/images/help/getting-started/files-and-folders.png)

Scroll down to the very bottom of the page and click the 
"Upload button" to upload the file into the Bucket.

![Properties](@/images/help/getting-started/properties.png)

You will see a summary of the file that you have just uploaded, 
click the "Close" button to return to the bucket overview page.

![Upload Status](@/images/help/getting-started/upload-status.png)

## Step 3: Create Policy to allow logs to be sent to Logit.io

You now have data to send to Logit.io. Still in AWS, in the search bar 
at the top of the-right of the page next to Services, type in "IAM" 
and then select this from the list as shown below:

![IAM](@/images/help/getting-started/IAM.png)

This takes you to the IAM Dashboard:

![IAM Dashboard](@/images/help/getting-started/IAM-dashboard.png)

On the left-hand side of the page there is a menu, from here click the "Policies" option.

![Identity and Access Management](@/images/help/getting-started/identity-access-management.png)

On the Policies page, click the "Create Policy" button found at the top-right.

![Policies](@/images/help/getting-started/policies.png)

On the Policies page, we need to press the "JSON" button.

![Specify Permissions](@/images/help/getting-started/specifiy-permissions.png)

Then we need to paste the text below into the Policy editor:

```json copy showLineNumbers
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Read",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "List",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Don't forget to change "your-bucket", which appears twice in the text, 
  to the name of your Bucket. In our example the bucket name is 
  "logit-test-bucket" so we update the code as follows:
</Callout>

![Policy Editor](@/images/help/getting-started/policy-editor.png)

Scroll down to the very bottom of the page and click the "Next" button.

![Next](@/images/help/getting-started/add-new-statement.png)

Enter a Policy name and a Description (optional)

![Review and Create](@/images/help/getting-started/review-create.png)

Scroll to the very bottom of the page and then click the "Create policy" button.

![Create Policy](@/images/help/getting-started/create-policy.png)

That's it for this step, we have now created a Policy that 
will allow us to send data from our bucket to Logit.io.

## Step 4: Create a User in AWS

You will then be taken to a page listing all of your policies. 
In the menu on the left-hand side of the screen click "Users" 
which appears under Access Management.

![Users](@/images/help/getting-started/users.png)

At the top of the Users page, click the "Create User" button

![Create User](@/images/help/getting-started/create-user.png)

Enter a user name and then click the "Next" button.

![Specify User Details](@/images/help/getting-started/specify-user-details.png)

You will be taken to the Set Permissions page, here you need to select the "Attach policies directly" option.

![Attach Policies Directly](@/images/help/getting-started/attach-policies-directly.png)

When you have selected the option, scroll to the very bottom of the page and click the "Next" button.

![Set Permissions Boundary](@/images/help/getting-started/set-permissions-boundary.png)

The next page is the Review and Create page, scroll to the bottom and click 
the "Create user" button. This will take you to the Users page where you 
will see the new user that has just been created.

## Step 5: Get Access Key and Secret Access Key

Click on the new user to go to the user details page.

![New User](@/images/help/getting-started/users(1).png)

On the user details page click the "Create access key" link.

![Create Access key](@/images/help/getting-started/s3.png)

Here we need to select the "Third-party service" option shown below.

![Third Party Service](@/images/help/getting-started/third-party-service.png)

Scroll down to the very bottom of the page and click the confirmation checkbox and then click the "Next" button.

![Confirmation Checkbox](@/images/help/getting-started/confirmation-checkbox.png)

Enter a description and then click the "Create access key" option.

![Create Access Key](@/images/help/getting-started/create-access-key.png)

Here you can see your Access Key. You can click to show and hide the Secret 
Access key. The Access Key and Secret Access Key are both required to send logs to Logit.io.

You can either copy the Access Key and Secret Access Key from here and 
save them somewhere or click to "Download .cvs file" which will save 
both into a file for you to use later.

![Retrieve Access Keys](@/images/help/getting-started/retrieve-access-keys.png)

We now have everything set up to enable us to send the logs from the bucket to Logit.io.

## Step 6: Creating an S3 Input in Logit.io

Ensure that you are signed in to Logit.io, then read through 
our [Amazon S3 data source integration guide](/integrations/log-management/aws/s3) to
start sending data to Logit.io.

<Callout type="info">
  If signed in to your Logit.io account, you should be able to 
  see your Stack details in the left panel of the Filebeat 
  instructions (as shown below) including stack id and port details.
</Callout>

If you don't see your stack details, 
[return to your dashboard](https://dashboard.logit.io/?utm_source=GettingStartedGuideFile&utm_medium=Dashboard) and 
choose View All Sources, this will ensure the instructions are 
pre-configured for the stack you're working with.

![Amazon S3 Logstash Configuration](@/images/help/getting-started/amazon-s3-logstash-configuration.png)

Scroll down to step 4 and click the "Configure AWS" button.

![Configure AWS](@/images/help/getting-started/configure-aws.png)

This will open the Logstash Amazon S3 Input Details page. We now need to 
fill in the details that we have from creating the policy and user on the AWS website.

<Callout type="info">
  Earlier we copied the bucket name, region and the access key 
  and secret access key and they need to be entered into the form as shown below.
</Callout>

Once this has been done click the "Test and configure input" button.

![Test and Configure Input](@/images/help/getting-started/test-configure-input.png)

You will be returned back to the Logstash Inputs page, in the top right-hand 
corner of the page there is a "Launch Logs" button. Click this button to 
view the contents of the log file that was uploaded to Amazon AWS earlier.

## Step 7: Verify and Search your Data

As OpenSearch Dashboards launches, which serves as the default log viewer, 
you will be prompted the first time to "Select your tenant." 
For most users, selecting the "Global" tenant is the recommended option.

<Callout type="info">
  You can always change the tenant later in your user settings inside of OpenSearch.
</Callout>

![Select Tenant](@/images/help/getting-started/select-tenant.png)

### The Discover View

After selecting your tenant, you are then redirected to the Discover View that 
allows you to explore and search the data arriving in your stack. It provides 
a user-friendly interface to quickly filter and find specific logs, metrics, 
or other data types.

![Discover View](@/images/help/getting-started/discover-view.png)

## Step 8: Monitor and Troubleshoot

You can view your data with predefined searches and dashboards that facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.

![Monitor and Troubleshoot](@/images/help/getting-started/monitor-troubleshoot.png)

You can browse our pre-configured dashboards and choose which to install by choosing Install Dashboards from your Logs Stack.

![Install Dashboards](@/images/help/getting-started/install-dashboards.png)

Once you've sent your logs to Logit.io, you can gain an in-depth perspective on the health and performance of your distributed cloud services through using real-time monitoring, and custom dashboards. This allows your team to dive deep into logs for troubleshooting, while simultaneously offering a broad view of your infrastructure's status via custom dashboards.
