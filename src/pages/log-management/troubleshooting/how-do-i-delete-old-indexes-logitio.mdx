# How do I delete old indexes in Logit.io?

Logit.io does not enable users to directly delete old index data through 
the platform as data retention and indexing is managed for you.

If you want to remove older indexes or delete specific older data then you 
will need to reach out to a member of the Logit.io support 
team <IntercomButton text="via live chat" />, this will create a 
support ticket automatically.

Logit.io typically manages data retention policies automatically, which 
means older data is automatically deleted based on the retention settings 
configured for your account. You can configure these retention policies 
according to your requirements per stack.
