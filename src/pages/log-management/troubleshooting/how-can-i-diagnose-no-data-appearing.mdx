# How can I diagnose no data appearing in Elasticsearch, OpenSearch or Grafana?

This article will help you diagnose no data appearing in your Logit.io Logs, Metrics or Tracing Stacks.

## 1. Ensure your data source is configured correctly 

Getting started sending data to your Logit.io Stacks is quick and simple, 
using the Data Source Integrations you can access pre-configured setups 
and snippets for nearly hundreds of data sources.

### How to use the Data Source Integrations

1. Login to your Logit.io account.
2. For any of your Logit.io stacks choose _Send Logs_, _Send Metrics_ or _Send Traces_.
3. Type the name of the data source you are configuring or just browse for it.
4. Follow the integration steps for your chosen data source (you can copy the snippets including pre-populated stack ids and keys!).

## 2. Enable logging if you are using an Elastic Beat

If you are using an Elastic Beat to send data into Elasticsearch or 
OpenSearch (e.g. Filebeat, Metricbeat etc.)  You can enable additional 
logging to the daemon by running it with the -e command line flag. This 
will redirect the output that is normally sent to Syslog to standard error. 
For example, see the command below.

```cmd copy
filebeat -e
```

You will be able to diagnose whether the Elastic Beat is able to harvest the 
files properly or if it can connect to your Logstash or Elasticsearch node.

## 3. Check Logstash logs for your stack

You can check the Logstash log output for your ELK stack from your dashboard.

From any Logit.io stack in your dashboard click `Diagnostic Logs` settings. 
You will see an output similar to below. Any errors with Logstash will appear here.

## 4. Can you see your data in OpenSearch?

To check if your data is in OpenSearch we need to query the indices. To do 
this you will need to know your endpoint address and your API Key. 
From any Logit.io Stack in your dashboard navigate to `OpenSearch` settings

To query the indices run the following curl command, substituting the endpoint 
address and API key for your own. Alternatively, you can navigate to the URL 
in a web browser remembering to substitute the endpoint address and API key for your own.

```cmd copy
curl "https://Your Endpoint-es.logit.io/_cat/indices?v&apikey=Your-API-Key"
```

You should see something returned similar to the below image. Anything that 
starts with . are system indices. Everything else are regular indices, if you 
can see regular indices that means your data is being received by Elasticsearch.

If your data is being sent to OpenSearch but you can't see it in OpenSearch Dashboards, 
it could be that you're querying one index in OpenSearch Dashboards but your data is 
in another index. You can refer to 
this [help article](/log-management/opensearch/index-management/index-patterns) to 
learn more about indexes.

## 5. Can you connect to your Logit.io Stack?
Can you connect to your stack or is your firewall blocking the connection?

Run the following commands to check if you can connect to your stack. 

<Callout type="info">
  Remember to substitute the Logstash endpoint address & 
  TCP SSL port for your own Logstash endpoint address & port.
</Callout>

### On Linux/MacOS

In terminal run:

```cmd copy
openssl s_client -connect <Your Logstash Endpoint>-ls.logit.io:<your-stack-TCP-SSL-port>
```

### On Windows

In Powershell run:

```powershell copy
Test-NetConnection -Port <your-stack-TCP-SSL-port> -ComputerName <Your Logstash Endpoint>-ls.logit.io -InformationLevel Detailed
```

If your ports are open you should receive output similar to the 
below ending with a verify return code of 0 from the Openssl command.

From Powershell you should see something similar to the below if the port is open:

![Powershell](@/images/help/log-management/troubleshooting/powershell.png)

You can find the details for your stacks Logstash endpoint address 
& TCP SSL port by navigating to `Logstash inputs` settings.

## 6. Can you resolve the DNS? 

To confirm you can connect to your stack use the example below to 
try and resolve the DNS of your stacks Logstash endpoint.

In Windows open a command prompt and run the following command:

```cmd copy
nslookup your-logstash-endpoint-ls.logit.io
```

On Linux / Unix / macOS you can use dig.

```cmd copy
dig a your-logstash-endpoint-ls.logit.io
```
