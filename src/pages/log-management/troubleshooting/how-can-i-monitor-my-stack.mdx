# How Can I Monitor My Logit.io Stack Health and Recover From Common Issues?

### How can I see the health of my stacks?

If you are experiencing performance problems shipping logs to Logit.io using Filebeat or 
other shippers it could indicate a problem with your OpenSearch stack. In order to 
diagnose what the potential issue may be you can check the health of your stack(s) 
by navigating to `Overview` settings.

### Using Overview to view the health of your stacks

![Stack Health](@/images/help/log-management/troubleshooting/stack-health.png)

There are status indicators for OpenSearch, Logstash and OpenSeach Dashboards 
instances. If there is an error or one of the instances requires attention, 
you will be notified here. In addition, you can also see if the stack has 
received data successfully over the last 24 hours.

If there aren't currently any issues with any of your stacks the status indicators 
will display green and healthy, anything different than this indicates a 
problem with at least one of your instances.

### Viewing the health of your stacks using your API Key

You can also check the health of your stack by accessing the API directly. 
To do this, from your Dashboard:

- Navigate to `OpenSearch` settings for your stack.
- Here you will see a section called "OpenSearch Api Access" which contains your Endpoint Address and your API Key.

Use these to create a URL in the format shown below:

```markdown
[Your Endpoint Address]/\_cluster/health?apikey=[Your Api Key]
```

This displays a list of values similar to what is shown below:

```json
{
  "cluster_name": "********-****-****-****-************",
  "status": "green",
  "timed_out": false,
  "number_of_nodes": 3,
  "number_of_data_nodes": 3,
  "active_primary_shards": 3,
  "active_shards": 6,
  "relocating_shards": 0,
  "initializing_shards": 0,
  "unassigned_shards": 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards": 0,
  "number_of_pending_tasks": 0,
  "number_of_in_flight_fetch": 0,
  "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis": 0,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number": 100.0
}
```

The main value to be concerned with here is the "status".

**Green** shows that everything is fine and your cluster is fully operational.

**Yellow** shows that Elasticsearch has allocated all of the primary shards but some or all of the replicas have not been allocated - if more shards were to disappear then this may impact your data.

**Red** indicates that some or all of the primary shards are not currently ready - you are missing data and any searches may return partial or incomplete results.

### Logstash logs and filters

Viewing your Logstash logs is another good way to get an overview of activity 
on your stack, and is, therefore, a good place to look when trying to diagnose 
Logstash configuration changes that may have impacted your stack performance. 
To view your Logstash logs from your Dashboard:

- Navigate to `Diagnostic Logs` settings for the stack that you want to investigate.

Your stack Logstash logs view gives you the ability to understand if there is a 
potential issue and where in the pipeline the cause may potentially lie. Could 
there be an issue with the data that you are sending? Is there a potential problem 
with how the data is being received and filtered? Is there a general problem with Logstash itself?

If the logs indicate a potential problem with Logstash and how it is processing the 
data that is being received, the problem may lie with your Logstash filters. If you 
have created custom filters it could be that they are preventing data from being 
processed. To view your Logstash filters from the dashboard:

- Navigate to `Logstash Pipelines` settings on the stack that you want to investigate.

You can sense check your Logstash filters and make any syntax changes as necessary. 
All Logit.io stacks enable you to test your Logstash filter syntax before applying them to your stack.

![Advanced Logstash Filter Settings](@/images/help/log-management/troubleshooting/advanced-logstash-filter-settings.png)

At the very bottom of the page, there is a section labelled "Advanced Logstash 
Filter Settings" with a "Restart Logstash" button. Pressing this will restart 
your Logstash instance. You will have to enter the name of your stack or your 
stack ID to confirm that you want to go ahead with the restart process, during this 
time Logstash is unable to receive any logs. Depending on the way that logs are 
being sent to Logstash, this could result in some logs being dropped.

### Rebuilding your stack

If you think that your OpensSearch has gone down Logit.io makes it easy for you to 
recover and rebuild the stacks yourself. You can rebuild any stack that you think 
is causing problems or failing to respond. If, for example, you have made changes 
or ran some commands that may be causing intermittent issues, then rebuilding may 
quickly resolve the problem. You will not lose your OpenSearch data when you rebuild
 the stack, however, there is a chance that any data that is currently in the 
 process of being sent may be lost.

#### To rebuild a stack:

- Navigate to the `Overview` settings for a service on the stack you wish to rebuild.
- From here scroll right down to the bottom of the page and you will see a section labelled "Advanced Settings".
- You will see a "Rebuild" button.

You will have to enter the name of your stack or your Stack ID to confirm that you want to go ahead with the rebuild process.
