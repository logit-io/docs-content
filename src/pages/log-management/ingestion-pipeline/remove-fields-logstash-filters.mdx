# How do I remove fields using Logstash filters?

When transporting data from a source to your Logit.io stacks using Logstash, there may be fields you do not wish to retain or see in OpenSearch Dashboards. You can remove these using the `mutate` filter plugin. There are several different ways of using this plugin to cover a wide range of use-cases, and so it is important to choose the right strategy depending on your situation.

If you always want to remove a field, or fields, from your data regardless of the situation, you can include the remove_field setting. This setting should point to an array of field names (or a single field name):

```plaintext
filter {
       mutate {
               remove_field => ["field_name"]
       }
 }
```

If the array only contains one field name, you can omit the square brackets:

```plaintext
remove_field => "field_name"
```

If you want to remove more than one field you can supply additional field names to the array:

```plaintext
filter {
    mutate {
        remove_field => [ "%{@index}","%{@version}","%{@type}" ]
    }
}
```

### Conditional Removals

Often you only want to remove a field if a given condition is true. One of the most common use-cases for a conditional remove is to only remove a field if the field's value matches another value:

```plaintext
if [action] == "login" {
   mutate {
           remove_field => ["last_login"]
           }
}
```

You can invert these conditions to remove a field if the condition is not true by using the not equals comparison operator (`!=`):

```plaintext
if [action] != "login"
```

To remove a field if the field's value makes up part of a larger string (i.e. a sub-string) you can use the special `in` keyword:

```plaintext
if [action] in "login" {
   mutate {
            remove_field => ["last_login"]
     }
 }
```

You can also use the `in` keyword to check if a field's value matches at least one of many strings in an array:

```plaintext
if [action] in ["hello", "world", "foo"] {
    mutate {
        remove_field => ["field_name"]
        }
 }
```

These types of conditions can be inverted using the `not` operator:

```plaintext
if [action] not in ["hello", "world", "foo"]
```

### Removing by range

If your field's value is an integer, you can check if the value is inside a
range of values. Before doing this, you must ensure that the value is interpreted
as an integer by Logstash and not a number inside a string. To do this, use the convert plugin:

```ruby copy
mutate {
  convert => [ "field_name", "integer" ]
}
```

Then you will be able to use a compound statement to compare the value against a
minimum and maximum value to check if the value is in range:

```ruby copy
if [field_name] > 50 and [field_name] < 100 {
  mutate {
    remove_field => [ "field_name" ]
  }
}
```

The above snippet will remove the `field_name` field if its value is between 50 and 100.
