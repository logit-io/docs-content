# How can I differentiate between different log types in Logstash

## Why would I want to differentiate between different log types?

If you are collecting two sets of logs using the same Elastic beat
source you may want to separate them so that you can perform certain
actions on them if they meet certain conditions.

For example, you may want to change the index name of one log type to help make it more identifiable.

## How do I separate my logs into different log types?

Differentiating between different log types in Logstash can be achieved
in various ways. If you are using an Elastic Beat source such as
Auditbeat, Filebeat or Metricbeat you can have multiple inputs sections
in your configuration file to distinguish between different types of logs
by editing the Beat configuration file and setting the type to be named differently.

For the example, below we are editing the Filebeat configuration
file to separate our logs into different types.

```yml copy
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: logType1
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - /var/folder_of_logs/*.log

  - type: logType2
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - /var/another_folder_of_logs/*.log
    fields_under_root: true
```

In the above example we have two folders that contain logs.

- /var/folder_of_logs/
- /var/another_folder_of_logs/

In order to tell the difference between the logs that are coming from
these folders, we have added logType1 to one set of logs and logType2 to the other set of logs. From here we can then use Logstash to further differentiate between these log types.

## Using Logstash to further differentiate between log types

To further differentiate between the log types, we need to make use of the
Logstash Filter. You can access your Logstash filters from the dashboard
for any of your Logit Stacks by navigating to `Logstash Pipelines` settings.

You can use Logstash to query log types in your Logstash filter and then
perform actions based upon that condition. For example, we may want to
change the index name the logs appear under in OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards.

```ruby copy
if [type] == "logType1" {
  mutate {
    add_field => { "[@metadata][beat]" => "YOURINDEXNAME" }
  }
}
else if [type] == "logType2" {
  mutate {
    add_field => { "[@metadata][beat]" => "YOURINDEXNAMETWO" }
  }
}
```

## Using log fields to distinguish log types

You can also query your log fields to check the log type if you have
created the field in your log. For example, you could create the `mylog.type`
field and then transform that field to iis.logs.

```ruby copy
if [mylog][type] == "my-iis-logs" {
  mutate {
    rename => { "[mylog][type]" => "[iis][logs]" }
  }
}
```
