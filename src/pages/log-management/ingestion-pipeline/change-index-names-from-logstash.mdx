# How can I change the index names from logstash-\*

Logit.io uses a predefined way to set the index names so by default all new Logit.io stacks that send data via Logstash have an index name of `logstash-*`.

### Can I change the index name to something different?

Absolutely, you can change the name of the index, or send your logs to multiple indexes by adding conditions to your Logstash filters.

  To edit your Logstash filters for any stack, go to the `Logstash Pipelines` settings.
</Callout>

If your sending your data via an OpenSearch beat such as Filebeat your condition should be:

```plaintext
mutate
{
  replace => { "[@metadata][beat]" => “YOURINDEXNAME” }
}
```

Alternatively, inside your condition you can specify the index name using `add_field`.

```plaintext
if[FIELD] == "CONDITION" {
   mutate
   {
      add_field => { "[@metadata][beat]" => "YOURINDEXNAME" }
   }
}
```

Where field is a field name within your logs. So if you wanted to have your IIS logs in their own index you could add:

```plaintext
if[type] == "iis" {
   mutate
   {
      add_field => { "[@metadata][beat]" => "iis" }
   }
}
```

### How can we re-index the data after an index name change?

Depending on the volume the simplest way is to resend the data, you can also use the re-index OpenSearch API. If you no longer require the historic data, you can simply delete the index.

### Are there any index name limitations with OpenSearch?

There are several limitations to what you can name your index. The complete list of limitations are:

- Lowercase only
- Cannot include `, /, *, ?, “, <, >, |, (space character), ,, #`
- Indices prior to 7.0 could contain a colon (:), but that's been deprecated and won't be supported in 7.0+
- Cannot start with -, \_, +
- Cannot be . or ..
- Cannot be longer than 255 bytes (note it is bytes, so multi-byte characters will count towards the 255 limit faster)
