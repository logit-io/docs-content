## Updating or Removing an Input

Clicking on "View Details" allows you to inspect and modify the configuration 
settings for the selected Logstash input. Clicking on "Remove" will permanently 
delete the selected Logstash input. _Please note that this action cannot be undone._

## Understanding Logstash Endpoints

To copy the Logstash endpoint, click the "Copy Endpoint" button. The endpoint 
is a critical element for sending data to your Logstash instance. Ensure to 
combine the copied endpoint with the appropriate input port based on your 
selected input type.

### Example:

- If you're using the TCP-SSL input type. Therefore, the Logstash endpoint 
for TCP-SSL would be `your-logstash-endpoint:your-tcp-ssl-port:`.

### Note:

- Verify the specific input port required for your chosen input type in the 
Logit.io documentation or configuration settings.

Understanding the correct combination of the Logstash endpoint and input 
port is crucial for establishing a secure and functional connection 
between Logstash and your data source.

## Set Minimum TLS Version

### Why Set Minimum TLS Version?

Setting the minimum TLS version is crucial for enhancing the security of your 
Logstash inputs. By configuring the appropriate TLS version, you ensure 
that communication between Logstash and your data sources is secure and 
meets the latest security standards.

1. Choose the desired TLS version from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Update Version" button to save your changes.
