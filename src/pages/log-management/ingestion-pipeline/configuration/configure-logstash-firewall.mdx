# Managing Stack Logstash Firewall Configurations

## Logstash Firewalls Introduction

Logstash Firewall Groups allow you to manage and restrict which IP addresses can 
send data to your stacks and which ports those restrictions apply to. Setting 
Firewall Groups improves stack security by blocking all unauthorised traffic 
to ports you've specified.

To view the existing Firewall Groups for a stack go to `Logstash Firewall` settings. 
You can add a new Firewall Group or edit an existing group to modify the 
configuration by selecting an existing one from the list.

You can also access the Logstash Firewall Groups for a stack by navigating to 
`Logstash Inputs` settings from where you can view rules specific to each input and 
port as shown below. Click View Rules to access the Firewall Groups for that input.

## Adding a new Firewall Group

To add a new Firewall Group for a stack go to `Logstash Firewall` setting and 
click _Add New Firewall Group_. Provide a name for the group and a brief description, 
then enter the IP address(es) that you want to allow to send data via your Logstash 
instance. Then if required choose from the list of ports that this should apply to, and select _Apply Changes._

## Modifying an existing Firewall Group

To modify an existing Firewall Group for a stack go to `Logstash Firewall`settings 
and click _Firewall Group_ for any that you need to modify or delete. From here you 
can rename the group, change the description, add/delete IP addresses from the group 
and modify the associated ports. Once you are happy with the changes select _Apply Changes._

To delete a specific IP address select it from the list and click _Delete rule_. If 
you have multiple rules you can use the _Select all_ and _Unselect all_ options to make this easier for you.

## Deleting a Firewall Group

To delete a Firewall Group completely including all the associated IP addresses and 
ports go to `Logstash Firewall` settings and click _Firewall Group_, then from the 
bottom of the screen choose the _Delete_ option. You will be asked to confirm the 
deletion as this action cannot be undone.
