# Logstash Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): Diagnosing and Troubleshooting Data Issues in OpenSearch on Logit.io

The Logstash Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is a powerful tool for diagnosing and 
troubleshooting issues with data not arriving into your OpenSearch stack on 
Logit.io. The DLQ captures events that encounter processing errors in your 
Logstash pipeline and stores them in a separate index for later analysis. 

In this article, we'll explore how to enable and use the DLQ to identify and 
resolve data issues in your Logstash pipeline and OpenSearch stack.

## When to Use the Logstash Dead Letter Queue

The DLQ can be used in various scenarios, including:

- Data is not appearing in your OpenSearch index.
- Data is appearing in your OpenSearch index, but it's missing fields or has incorrect field values.
- You're seeing errors or warnings in your [Logstash logs](/log-management/troubleshooting/how-can-i-monitor-my-stack#logstash-logs-and-filters) related to event processing.
- You suspect that there may be issues with your Logstash pipeline configuration or OpenSearch mappings.
- You're not sure where in your Logstash pipeline the data is failing.
- You're experiencing intermittent or sporadic data issues that are difficult to diagnose.
- You're testing a new Logstash pipeline configuration or OpenSearch mapping and want to ensure that it's working correctly before deploying it to production.

## Enabling the DLQ

Enabling the DLQ in your Logstash pipeline on 
Logit.io is easy. Simply follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Logit.io account and navigate to your stack's Log Management `Overview` settings.
2. Scroll down to the "Advanced Stack Settings" section.
3. Under the "Logstash Dead Letter Queue" section, choose Enable DLQ. If the button shows Disable DLQ then this feature is already enabled for your stack.

With the DLQ enabled, any events that encounter processing errors in your 
Logstash pipeline will be captured and stored in the DLQ index for later analysis.

## Viewing the DLQ in OpenSearch on Logit.io

Once you've enabled and configured the DLQ, you can inspect 
the failed events in OpenSearch to identify any issues with 
your data or Logstash pipeline. Here's how to do it:

1. Click `Launch Logs` for your stack.
2. Click the "Discover" tab in the left-hand menu.
3. In the "Index pattern" field, select the dlq-*.
4. You should see a list of events that encountered processing errors in your Logstash pipeline.
5. You can click expand an event to see its details and diagnose any issues.

Each DLQ entry has the fields **dead_letter_queue_reason** and 
**original_data** fields that can help to diagnose mapping 
conflicts and other issues that prevent your data being processed.

## Resolving Failed Events from the DLQ

Once you have identified and resolved the underlying issues causing 
events to fail and land in the DLQ, you can retry processing these 
events in your Logstash pipeline. Here's how you can retry failed 
events from the DLQ:

1. Review the events in the DLQ in OpenSearch, as explained earlier in this article.
2. Identify the root cause of the failures and make the necessary changes to your [Logstash configuration](/log-management/ingestion-pipeline/configuration/configure-logstash-filters) or [OpenSearch mappings](/log-management/opensearch/index-management/mapping/overview) to resolve the issues.
3. Once you are confident that the issues have been addressed, you can retry the failed events.
4. Monitor the reprocessing to ensure that the events are successfully processed and indexed in your OpenSearch stack.

By retrying failed events from the DLQ, you can ensure that 
data is correctly processed and prevent data loss.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Monitoring the DLQ is crucial to proactively identify and 
address data processing issues. You can leverage your Logit.io 
stacks to monitor the DLQ and receive alerts. Here are some 
monitoring and alerting practices to consider:

- **Monitor DLQ Event Count:** Track the number of events in the DLQ over time. Set up monitoring thresholds to be alerted if the DLQ event count exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential issues with data processing.
- **Monitor DLQ Error Patterns:** Look for recurring error patterns or specific error codes in the DLQ events. Create custom monitoring queries or use Logstash monitoring plugins to detect these patterns and generate alerts.
- **Configure Notifications:** Set up notifications and alerting such as email alerts, Slack notifications, or notify incident management tools. This ensures that you are promptly notified of any critical issues or a sudden increase in failed events in the DLQ.

Monitoring and alerting provide proactive visibility into data 
processing issues, allowing you to address them promptly and 
maintain data integrity in your OpenSearch stack.
