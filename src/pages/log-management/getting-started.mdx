# Get Started Sending Logs

Setting up, configuring and sending logs and metrics to Logstash can 
appear to be a complicated process, this guide aims to show you that 
by using Logit.io it is actually a simple process.

### Where to start...

Filebeat is the most popular tool for ingesting logs and metrics because 
it works with minimal configuration and with a wide range of common log 
formats. For this reason, we recommend it as a good place to start.

<Callout type="info">
  Remember, Filebeat doesn't cover all logging scenarios and that is why there are several 
  different shippers available. If you don't think that Filebeat is the solution that 
  meets your needs then please take a look at other options in our [Data Source Integrations.](/integrations)
</Callout>

### Installing Filebeat

After you have created your first Logit.io, navigate to `Send Logs` 
settings and then click _View All Sources_ to get started.

As mentioned earlier, we are going to use the recommended Filebeat in our example 
so click _Log Management_, then click _Shippers_ and finally click _Filebeat_ to continue.

<Callout type="info">
  If you do require a shipper other than Filebeat, this is where you choose it. 
  Choosing a shipper will show you the source wizard that explains 
  how to get up and running with your chosen data source.
</Callout>

The first section of the wizard contains instructions for installing Filebeat. 
The instructions cover several OS so please follow the instructions for the 
OS that you are using. There are instructions for installing Filebeat on 
Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, macOS and Windows. However, 
if you are using a different OS to the ones listed, try the link at the 
bottom for the downloads page to see if you can find what you require.

Next, you need to locate the configuration file, the wizard shows you where to 
find this file for each type of OS. Click the "next step" button to do this.

### Configuring the inputs

We need to open the configuration file and make some changes. These changes are 
also described in the source wizard. Search for the filebeat.inputs section. 
You will see the following two lines in the file:

```yaml
# Change to true to enable this input configuration.
enabled: false
```
Change the enabled to true. It should now look as follows:

```yaml
# Change to true to enable this input configuration.
enabled: true
```

You will also see the following lines in the filebeat.inputs section:

```yaml
# Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
paths:
  - /var/log/*.log
  #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*
```

This is how you tell Filebeat where the files that you wish to ingest are located. 
Filebeat is currently looking in the directory */var/log/* for files. 
The Asterisk means it is looking for all files in this directory with the .log 
extension but it is possible to be more specific and actually name the files 
here if this is what you want to do. Change this to point to where your log files are located.

Let's now skip forward to the configure output section of the wizard. 
Click the "Next step" button until you arrive at this section.

### Configure Output

In this example, we are sending data to Logstash rather than OpenSearch so we 
must comment out all of the lines in the configuration file that relate 
to OpenSearch. Commenting out is done using the hash symbol. The OpenSearch 
output section of the configuration file should look as follows:

```yaml
# output.elasticsearch:
# Array of hosts to connect to.
#  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
# Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
# protocol: "https"
# username: "elastic"
# password: "changeme"
```

Now we need to update the Logstash output section of the configuration 
file to include your settings. You will notice that the wizard actually 
displays your unique settings to save you from looking them up.

Currently, the hosts line in the configuration file will look as follows:

```yaml
#hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
```

You need to remove the hash and then copy over the localhost part 
with the settings shown in the wizard so that it looks similar to below:

```yaml
hosts: ["11111111-aaaa-1111-1111-111111111111-ls.logit.io:0"]
```

You then need to add the following two lines to the section:
```yaml
loadbalance: true
ssl.enabled: true
```
When finished, the Logstash output section of the configuration 
file should look similar to the following:

```yaml
#output.logstash:
# The Logstash hosts
hosts: ["11111111-aaaa-1111-1111-111111111111-ls.logit.io:0"]
# Optional SSL. By default is off.
# List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
#ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
# Certificate for SSL client authentication
#ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"]
# Client Certificate Key
#ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"]
loadbalance: true
ssl.enabled: true
```

Now we are ready to validate the file. Click "Next step" to do this.

### Validate Configuration

This section shows us how to check that the updates we have made to the 
configuration file during the configuration process haven't broken the format. 
Again there are instructions for several OS's so follow the instructions for 
the one that you are using. If the validation fails then go back to the 
Configuring Inputs and Configuring Outputs sections and check that your 
file is in the same format as the example shown.

When the validation has passed we are ready to start ingesting data. 
Click the "Next step" button to learn how to start doing this.

### Start Filebeat
There are instructions that show how to start Filebeat for each type of OS. 
Follow the instructions for the system that you are using.

### Confirm data is in OpenSearch

Having followed the instructions we should now be able to view the logs. 
To do this click the _Launch Logs_ button for your stack.

<Callout type="info">
  OpenSearch Dashboard and Grafana are the tools that you will use to 
  visualise your data, we can use them to see any logs and metrics that 
  have been sent to OpenSearch on this stack.
</Callout>

When OpenSearch Dashboards is launched you should be able to see the logs 
and metrics that were ingested into OpenSearch by Logstash. It is possible 
to filter this data by time, fields, and content, so feel free to explore!

### Troubleshooting?

If you don't see any logs or metrics in OpenSearch Dashboards and/or Grafana then there are a few things that you should check.
- Are there any files in the folder that was added during file inputs configuration?
- Is the format of the configuration file correct? Does it validate?
- Do the Logstash settings in the file match the settings in the source wizard? Have they been copied correctly?
