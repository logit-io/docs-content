## Getting Started Sending Logs to Your Logit.io Stack

<Steps>
  ### Send Sample Log

  First, verify that you can send a sample log message to your stack using Logit.io's API.

  <Tabs items={["Windows (via Command Prompt)", "Windows (via PowerShell)", "macOS", "Linux"]}>
    <Tab>    
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i ^
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" ^
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
      -H "LogType: json" ^
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 ^
      -d "{\"message\":\"Sample message from my computer\"}"
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy /@apikey/ 
      $headers = @{
        ApiKey = "@apikey"
        "Content-Type" = "application/json"
        LogType = "json"
      }

      $body = @{
        "message" = "Sample message from my computer"
      } | ConvertTo-Json

      curl -Uri "https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2" `
        -Method Post `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Body $body
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i \
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "LogType: json" \
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 \
      -d '{"message":"Sample message from my computer"}'
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i \
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "LogType: json" \
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 \
      -d '{"message":"Sample message from my computer"}'
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  You should expect to receive a `202 ACCEPTED` response:

  ```cmd
  HTTP/1.1 202 ACCEPTED
  {"message":"Message Received, Thanks"}
  ```
