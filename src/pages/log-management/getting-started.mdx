## Getting Started Sending Logs

Here are the steps you need to take to start sending logs to your Logit.io stack.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes you have curl installed on your computer. 
  It comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions, macOS and Windows 10/11. 
  To install curl on earlier versions of Windows, please refer to [these instructions](https://curl.se/windows/).

<Steps>
  ### Send Sample Log

  First, verify that you can send a sample log message to your stack using Logit.io's API.

  <Tabs items={["Windows (via Command Prompt)", "Windows (via PowerShell)", "macOS", "Linux"]}>
    <Tab>    
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i ^
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" ^
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
      -H "LogType: json" ^
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 ^
      -d "{\"test-field-name\":\"test-field-value\"}"
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy /@apikey/ 
      $headers = @{
        ApiKey = "@apikey"
        "Content-Type" = "application/json"
        LogType = "json"
      }

      $body = @{
        "test-field-name" = "test-field-value"
      } | ConvertTo-Json

      curl -Uri "https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2" `
        -Method Post `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Body $body
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i \
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "LogType: json" \
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 \
      -d '{"test-field-name":"test-field-value"}'
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash copy /@apikey/ 
      curl -i \
      -H "ApiKey: @apikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "LogType: json" \
      https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 \
      -d '{"test-field-name":"test-field-value"}'
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  You should expect to receive a `202 ACCEPTED` response:

  ```cmd
  HTTP/1.1 202 ACCEPTED
  {"message":"Message Received, Thanks"}
  ```

  ### View Your Data
  
  To view the sample log, you can either press the `Launch Logs` button 
  on your Logit.io dashboard or by pressing the `View My Data` button below:

  <LaunchVisualizer />

  That's it! You have successfuly sent data to your stack and viewed it in an 
  Opensearch Dashboard. This is, of course, just the beginning.
  
  ### Integrating Your Data Source

  The next step is to integrate your data source with your Logit.io stack to 
  be able   to ship real log data. Logit.io provides more than 350 data source 
  integration guides   to help you get started. You can browse our collection 
  using the link below to find the right guide for your use-case.
