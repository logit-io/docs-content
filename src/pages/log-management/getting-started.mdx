You can send data to your Log Management service in a few seconds by following this guide.

To install on earlier versions of Windows you can follow the instructions [here](https://curl.se/windows/). 

If you are logged in the Logit.io API endpoint and key values you need to send data to us will be pre-populated. If you are not logged in please do so and return to this guide.
