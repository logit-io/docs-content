# Accessing Grafana features via REST API

You can use Basic Authentication to connect to the Logit.io Proxy and access Grafana without having to go 
through the Logit.io Dashboard. This can improve your user experience and allow proper integration between your company, your applications 
and the Logit.io service.

You can, if you choose to, connect your application directly to Logit.io to do a range of things such as saving dashboards, creating users, 
and updating data sources etc. or access Grafana straight from your computer. 

This article explains how to call REST API Endpoints to access Grafana using our Logit.io proxy and connect to it using Basic 
Authentication.

<Callout type="info">
    Basic Authentication is a simple authentication method in HTTP(S) where the client includes a username and password with each request. 
    The username and password is combined with a colon in-between as a string. You don't need to worry about how to create a basic authentication 
    header as we have done it for you. 
</Callout>

Each request to a REST API Endpoint must include all of the necessary information for Grafana to fulfill the request. If all the necessary 
information is provided the API requests return JSON output.

Use the following operations to interact with Grafana via the Logit.io Proxy.

* __GET__ - Fetches the information.
* __POST__ - Adds new information.
* __PUT__ - Updates the existing information.
* __PATCH__ - Applies partial modifications to the existing information.
* __DELETE__ - Removes the information.

All the details that you require in order to connect to the Logit.io proxy are found on the Profile Settings page of the Logit.io Dashboard. 
The Profile Settings page has a section called `Proxy Settings` where you will find everything that you need.

There are two ways that you can call the REST API using the Logit.io proxy. The call to our proxy needs to be in either of the following formats:

__Basic Authentication header__:

```bash
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-H "Authorization: Basic {basic auth header}" {endpoint to call}
```

__Proxy Username and Password__:

```bash
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-u "{proxy username}:{proxy password}" {endpoint to call}
```

Below are two curl request examples that show how to connect to the Logit.io Proxy. The examples use the Stack Id of a Stack that you have access to. 
If you need to access another of your stacks then you can simply find the Stack that you require, retrieve the stack Id from that stack and then 
replace it. 

<ProxyAuthPlaceholderWarning stackType="logs" />

### Example of a curl request to access your Logit.io Grafana instance

This first method uses the __Basic Auth Header__:

```bash copy /@proxyAuthSetting.basicAuthHeader/ /@metrics_id/
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-H "Authorization: ^
Basic @proxyAuthSetting.basicAuthHeader" ^
https://grafana.logit.io/s/@logs_id/api/health
```

This second method uses the __proxy username and password__:

```bash copy /@proxyAuthSetting.username/ /@proxyAuthSetting.password/ /@metrics_id/
curl -XGET -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-u "@proxyAuthSetting.username:@proxyAuthSetting.password" ^
https://grafana.logit.io/s/@logs_id/api/health
```

Both curl requests call the same API Endpoint. This request returns detailed information about your Grafana instance’s health.

There are many other Grafana features that can be accessed via REST API through the Logit.io Proxy. These features are explained in the 
Grafana docs [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/)
