# Can I use HTML in email alerts?

### Requirements

In short, yes. However, you will need to have at least Elastalert version 0.1.33 
installed against your stack. Fear not, as most Logit stacks should have at least 
the minimum version of Elastalert required in order to use HTML in alerts.

### Provisioning Elastalert and setting up an alert

You will also need to have Elastalert provisioned and an alert set-up. You can follow this 
guide [here](/log-management/alerting/notifications/emails) to set up an example rule.

### What version of Elastalert do I have?

Currently, there is no way a user can check what version of Elastalert is installed. 
If you wish to know what version of Elastalert is installed on your stack, just reach 
out to our support engineers from live chat in your dashboard.
