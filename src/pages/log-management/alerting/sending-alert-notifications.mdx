# Options for sending alerts from your logs stack for different scenarios

## Introduction

This guide is designed to assist users who are setting up alert rules 
for their Log Management stacks on Logit.io and provides step-by-step 
instructions for different scenarios, in addition to some 
FAQs that you might find useful.

## 1. Receiving an alert when a specific field changes value in a certain time window

### Problem:

You want to receive alerts when the "MyFieldName" field in the 
JSON payload is set to true in a certain time period.

### Solution:

Use the **Spike Rule** to achieve this. This rule type allows you to 
trigger alerts based on specific conditions in the JSON payload. In 
our case, it's perfect for detecting when "MyFieldName" is set to true.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Navigate to the `Alert & Notifications` settings.
2. Click the _Enable Alerting_ button (if alerting is not already enabled).
3. Click on _Create Rule_ to start a new rule configuration.
4. Select the **Spike Rule** type from the available options.
5. Configure the rule query to "MyFieldName:MyFieldValue"
6. Set the **hours, spike_height and spike_type** based on your monitoring needs.
7. Choose the desired alert action, such as sending an email or Slack notification.
8. Save the rule to activate it.

**Example template:**

```yaml copy
name: "Spike example alert"
type: spike
index: "*-*"
timeframe:
  hours: 7
spike_height: 1
spike_type: "up"
query:
  query_string:
    query: "MyFieldName:MyFieldValue"
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

## 2. Customizing Rules for Different Applications or Computers

### Problem:

You have multiple applications or computers and want distinct alerts 
for errors from each. The same rule will work for any errors that are 
reported, irrespective of the machine they came from. The information 
in the alert will tell you the details about which machine is alerting.

### Solution:

Leverage the flexibility of Logit.io's alerting engine. Create rules 
based on various fields in your JSON payload to differentiate and 
categorize alerts based on unique criteria. It may be worth configuring 
separate alerts for different machines by restricting the query value 
to only alerts based on the required field and machine name.

Follow these detailed steps to create rules tailored to each application or computer:

**Step-by-Step:**
1. In the **Alert & Notifications** section, click on "Create Rule."
2. Under the rule configuration, use the **query** filter in ElastAlert to specify the field conditions for each application or computer.
3. Customize the alert action based on your requirements, considering different notification channels or formats.
4. Save the rule to activate it.

**Example template:**

```yaml copy
name: "Any match alert example"
type: any
index: "*-*"
filter:
- query:
  query_string:
     query: "agent.machinename:myserver AND status: MyFieldName:MyFieldValue"
    
alert:
  - "slack"
slack_webhook_url:
  - “[YOUR SLACK HOOK]”
```

## 3. Detecting Web Request Interruptions

### Problem:

You want to receive alerts if the web request stops coming in, indicating a potential interruption.

### Solution:

Implement rules using the **Flatline Alert Type** in ElastAlert. This 
rule type is suitable for scenarios where you want to be alerted if you 
receive a very small number of logs, indicating a potential 
interruption in the data flow.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Create a new rule with the **Flatline Alert Type**.
2. Configure the rule to trigger when the number of logs falls below a specified threshold within a set timeframe.
3. Set up the alert action, such as sending an email or Slack notification.
4. Save the rule to activate it.

Example template:

```yaml copy
name: "Heartbeat flatline Example Alert"
type: flatline
index: "*-*"
threshold: 100
timeframe:
  minutes: 10
filter:
- query:
    query_string:
      query: "message: heartbeat*"
use_count_query: true
doc_type: _doc
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

## 4. Fine-Tuning Rule Execution Frequency

### Problem:

You prefer immediate alerts upon error detection without much historical tracking.

### Solution:

By default, Logit.io's rules are executed every 1 minute which for 
most use cases is suitable. Adjust the **time frame and execution frequency** 
in your rules based on your preference for alerts.

If you need the alerts to run more frequently than every 1 
minute reach out to us via the normal support channels.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often are the rules executed?**

A: By default, rules in Logit.io are executed every 1 minute. You 
can adjust the execution frequency for each rule based on your specific requirements.

**Q: Can I receive alerts only upon immediate error detection?**

A: Yes, you can fine-tune the execution frequency and time frame in 
your rules to receive immediate alerts upon error detection without 
much historical tracking. Follow these detailed steps, and you'll 
be able to configure Log alert rules tailored to your specific needs in Logit.io
