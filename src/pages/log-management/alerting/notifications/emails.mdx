# How to send email alerts & notifications from Logit

It only takes a few minutes to add Alerting to any of your Logit ELK stacks. 
Once enabled, you'll be able to edit and set up alerting rules for all 
your stacks and to as many different email addresses as you need!

## Provision Alerting for your Stack

To enable alerting for a stack, navigate to `Alerting & Notifications` 
settings and then click _Enable Alerting_.

## Create your Alerting Rule

Use the code block below to quickly get started with your email alert.

```yaml copy
name: Production App Errors

type: any

# (Required)
# Index to search, wildcard supported

index: logstash-*

## Receive an alert for every single match

realert:
  minutes: 0

# (Required)
# A list of elasticsearch filters used for find events
# These filters are joined with AND and nested in a filtered query

filter:
- query:
    query_string:
      query: "type: error"

# (Required)
# The alert used when a match is found
alert:
  - "email"

# (required, email specific)
# a list of email addresses to send alerts to

email:
  - "me@logit.io"
```

## How to use the code

1. Paste the code into the alert replacing any existing rule.
2. Then just edit the code to match the filter query you need, in this case we are looking for matches on "type:error".
3. Replace me@logit.io with the required email address.
4. Choose test to run the rule against your data over the last 2 hrs.
5. Once happy, choose update to apply and save the rule.

## Configure alerts to send emails to more than one email address

Now that you have your new alert rule set up you may want to 
alert more than one email at a time. To do this you will need 
to edit the code which contains your rule.

### Edit your code

At the bottom of the code, there is the option for email followed 
by the 'me@logit.io" email address. To add another simply add a 
separate line followed by the email address. For example - 

```yaml copy
# (required, email specific)
# a list of email addresses to send alerts to

email:
  - "me@logit.io"
  - "you@logit.io"
  - "them@logit.io"
```

### Test your alert

Once you have added the required emails you need to test the rule 
works. So choose either test option.

Once the test passes hit the update rule button, this will save and enable 
the alert rule for your stack. You can see from the console output more 
details about how your alert rule will behave once applied.
