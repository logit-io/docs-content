# How to send alerts & notifications from Logit.io to Slack

It only takes a few minutes to add alerting to any of your Logit.io stacks. Once enabled, you'll be able to edit and set up alerting rules for all your stacks.

### Provision Alerting for a Stack
To enable alerting for a stack, navigate to `Alerting & Notifications` settings and then click _Enable Alerting_.

### Create your Alerting Rule
Use the code block below to quickly get started with your Slack alert.
```yaml
name: Production App Errors

type: any

index: logstash-*

filter:
  - query:
      query_string:
        query: "type:error"

## Receive an alert for every single match
realert:
  minutes: 0

# (Required)
# The alert used when a match is found
alert:
  - "slack"

## Live alerts channel
slack_webhook_url:
  - “[YOUR SLACK HOOK]”
```
### How to use the code
1. Paste the code into the alert replacing any existing rule.
2. Then just edit the code to match the filter query you need, in this case, we are looking for matches on "type:error".
3. Replace [YOUR SLACK HOOK] with your slack hook URL.
4. Choose test to run the rule against your data over the last 2 hrs.
5. Once happy, choose update to apply and save the rule.

Now you're all set to send alerts to Slack from Logit.io!
