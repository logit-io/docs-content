# Configure Flatline Alerts for OpenSearch

A Flatline alert matches when the total number of events is under a given 
threshold for a specified time period. The threshold is the minimum number 
of events required to prevent an alert from being triggered. If the time 
period contains fewer than the threshold value, an alert will be triggered.

**Flatline Type -** Match when there are less than X events in Y time

For example, if you want to check the frequency of heartbeat messages 
that drop **below 100** in **ten minutes**, the alert will be triggered 
when this condition is met. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml copy
name: "Heartbeat Flatline Example Alert"
type: flatline
index: "*-*"
threshold: 100
timeframe:
  minutes: 10
filter:
  - query:
      query_string:
        query: "message: heartbeat*"
use_count_query: true
doc_type: _doc
alert: 
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

Using the example above you can ensure that you have a working flatline alert. 
To have a working alert rule you will need the following:

- The `name` of the alert 
- The `type` set to `flatline` 
- The `index` that you need to check against 
- The `threshold`  you require 
- The `timeframe`  you want to set and 
- The `query` you are checking against.

### Additional Options

Additional options that you may want to include in your alert rule are explained below.

`use_terms_query` is an additional option, which if you set to true then 
ElastAlert will make an aggregation query against OpenSearch to get 
counts of documents matching each unique value of the `query_key`

The `query_key` which can be set similarly to the `query` looks like this:

```yaml copy
query_key: "message: heartbeat*"
```

This means that an alert will be triggered if any value of the `query_key` 
has been seen at least once and then falls below the threshold.

If your timeframe is 10 minutes and you look for events that happened in the 
last 10 minutes, `timeframe_elapsed` will always default to False.

For flatline rules, `first_event` gets populated with an empty "placeholder" 
timestamp after the first query is made. So, it's guaranteed to get populated 
after the first query.

### Troubleshooting

Make sure to proofread the rule you have written to ensure that it is what you 
expect to see as most of the issues regarding alerts not working correctly are 
related to the points above. Below are some examples of common issues:

- Issues with YAML spacing/formatting
- Incorrect syntax 
- Required fields for rules that are missing
- Two rules with the same name
