# Configure Percentage Match Alerts for OpenSearch

## A Percentage Match alert

A Percentage Match alert matches when the percentage of documents within a 
`match_bucket_filter` within a calculation window (by default `buffer_time`) 
is higher or lower than a relative percentage value `max_percentage`.

This would allow you to receive alerts in scenarios such as if there is a 
**20% increase** `max_percentage` in the number of **500 errors** 
`match_bucket_filter` within a **15 minutes timeframe** `buffer_time` 
you would receive an alert to your configured channel. 

Here is an example below:

```yaml copy
name: "Percentage match example"
type: percentage_match
index: "*-*"
filter:
  - query:
      query_string:
        query: "agent.hostname:azure"
match_bucket_filter:
  - query_string:
      query: "router.status: [500 TO 599]"
doc_type: _doc
max_percentage: 20
buffer_time:
  minutes: 3
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

## Additional Options

In addition, you can also provide a `filter` query to limit the 
initial results that the `match_bucket_filter` will be applied to.
