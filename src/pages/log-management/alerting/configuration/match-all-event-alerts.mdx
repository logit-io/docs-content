# Configure Alerts for OpenSearch to match all/any events for a specific query

An 'Any Alert' as its name suggests will match **any** events that match the query `filter`.

Use the `type` **any** to match all limits the results you use a query 
filter as shown in the example below. You can simply cut and paste this 
example into your new Logit.io alert and then modify the elastic query 
to match the required events. Next, update the email address and test and run the alert.

```yaml copy
name: "Any match alert example"
type: any
index: "*-*"
filter:
- query:
   query_string:
      query: "agent.hostname:azure AND status: [500 TO 599]"      
alert:
- "email"
email:
- "example@logit.io"
```
