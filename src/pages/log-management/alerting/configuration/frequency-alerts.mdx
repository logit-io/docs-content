# Configure Frequency Alerts for OpenSearch

A Frequency alert matches when there are at least a certain 
number of events `num_events` in a given `timeframe`.

This would allow you to receive alerts in scenarios such as if 
there are **100 or more events** `num_events` matching the specified 
filter `query` and the events all happen within a **3-hour window** 
`timeframe` you would receive an alert to your configured channel. 

Here is an example below:

```yaml copy
name: "Frequency alert example"
type: frequency
index: "*-*"
timeframe:
  hours: 3
num_events: 100
filter:
  - query:
      query_string:
        query: "router.status: [500 TO 599]"
realert:
  minutes: 10
exponential_realert:
  hours: 8
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

## Additional Options

In addition, you can also provide a `realert` to ignore repeating 
alerts for the defined period of time. You can also provide an 
`exponential_realert` value and this will exponentially increase 
the value `realert` while alerts continue to fire.
