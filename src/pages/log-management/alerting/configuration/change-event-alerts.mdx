# Configure Change Alerts for OpenSearch

A Change alert matches when a certain monitored field value `compare_key` 
changes, the field must change for the last event with the same `query_key` field value.

This would allow you to receive alerts in scenarios such as if there is a 
match on two events for the same **username field** `query_key` and the 
**country_name field** `compare_key` is different in the **same day** `timeframe`.

Additionally, you can choose to `ignore_null` values, this will mean that 
events without a `compare_key` will not count as changed. Here is an example below:

```yaml copy
name: "Change alert example"
type: change
index: "*-*"
compare_key: country_name
ignore_null: true
query_key: username
timeframe:
  days: 1
filter:
  - query:
      query_string:
        query: "type: login"
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

### Additional Options

In addition, you can also provide a `timeframe` value to define the 
maximum time between changes, after which time period the previous 
value of compare_key will be forgotten.
