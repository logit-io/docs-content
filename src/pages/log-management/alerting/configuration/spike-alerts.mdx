# Configure Spike Alerts for OpenSearch

A Spike alert matches when the volume of events during a given time 
period is larger or smaller based on `spike_height` than during the 
previous time period `timeframe`.

This would allow you to receive alerts in scenarios such as if there 
is **3 times spike up based on a ratio value** `spike_height` in the 
number of events matching the `filter` query, when compared to the 
previous time window for events `timeframe`. 

Here is an example below:

```yaml copy
name: "Spike example alert"
type: spike
index: "*-*"
timeframe:
  hours: 2
spike_height: 3
spike_type: "up"
query:
  query_string:
    query: "router.status: [500 TO 599]"
alert:
  - "email"
email:
  - "example@logit.io"
```

## Additional Options

In addition, you can also provide a `threshold_cur` value that 
allows you to configure the minimum number of events that must 
exist in the current window for an alert to be fired.
