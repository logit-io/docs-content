# How do timezones work in OpenSearch?

OpenSearch uses the timezone of your browser by default, 
it is however possible to change this if you require.

### How do I change the timezone?

To change the timezone navigate to the following:

_OpenSearch > Management > Advanced Settings_

![OpenSearch Advanced Settings](@/images/help/log-management/storage/opensearch-advanced-settings.png)

You will see lots of settings here that control the behaviour of _OpenSearch_, 
one of which is the timezone. The setting you are looking for is as follows:

_dateFormat:tz_

You can see that _'Browser'_ is the timezone currently selected. Click 
the _'Edit'_ button for this item and you will be presented with a dropdown list.

![Timezone](@/images/help/log-management/storage/timezone.png)

Pick the timezone that you require from the list and press the save button. If you 
now click _'Discover'_ on the left-hand menu to return to your results you will 
see that data is now displayed using the new timezone that you selected.

<Callout type="info">
  Both OpenSearch and Logstash use the UTC timezone for timestamps. 
  Although this can be changed it is recommended to keep the standard 
  and leave adjustments to OpenSearch or any other presentation layers you may use.
