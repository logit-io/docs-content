# OpenSearch Dashboards and Visualizations Overview

## What are OpenSearch Dashboards and Visualizations?

OpenSearch Dashboards is an open-source data visualization and 
exploration tool that is commonly used with the OpenSearch search 
and analytics engine. OpenSearch Dashboards allow users to create 
interactive and customizable data visualizations like charts, graphs, 
and maps. You can visualize data from various sources, including 
log files, databases, and other structured or unstructured data.

## Working with OpenSearch Dashboards

Navigate to the Log Management `Overview` settings. To the far 
right of this section, you will find the 'Visualizations' card. 
Here you can utilize dashboards to gain insights, investigate, 
and analyze your log data, to enable well-informed decision-making, 
this can be conducted by selecting 'Launch' next to 'OpenSearch Dashboards'.

## Install Dashboards

By clicking on the ellipses, a small menu will appear. If you select 
'Install Dashboards' it will take you to a page where you can choose 
from a range of pre-configured custom data source dashboards for 
installation and visualization within your stack.

### OpenSearch Dashboards Settings

Below 'Install Dashboards' in the ellipses menu is 'OpenSearch Dashboards Settings'. 
If you click this link you will be able to view further details and version 
information for the OpenSearch Dashboards running in your stack and activate 
multi-stack functionality for OpenSearch Dashboards.

### Grafana Settings

The final option in the menu is 'Grafana Settings'. If you select this you 
have the option to enable the Grafana visualizer for your Log Management stack, 
allowing you to choose between OpenSearch Dashboards and/or Grafana 
for deeper log analysis.

### OpenSearch Dashboards Nodes

Lastly, from the Visualizations card you can view your 'OpenSearch Dashboard Nodes'. 
OpenSearch nodes refer to individual instances of the OpenSearch software that 
run as part of a cluster. These nodes work together to form a distributed and 
scalable system for storing and searching data. Here you can view each 
individual instance and its health.

### Viewing OpenSearch Dashboards

Once you have selected “Launch Logs” at the top of the overview page you will be 
able to generate your first dashboard in order to visualize your data. In OpenSearch 
from the left-hand menu you can select “overview” under “OpenSearch Dashboards” to 
get started with visualizing your data for the first time:

You also have the option to add sample data. This will generate an example dashboard 
that can be cloned, edited, and adjusted to help you see the options for
