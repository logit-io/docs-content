### Moving between different versions of OpenSearch

In some cases exporting and importing OpenSearch objects may not always reimport successfully.
However, this is rare. Along as you always have an export it can be quite
simple to recreate the objects using your exported data. For example:

- Dashboards may not import cleanly on a different version of OpenSearch
- You may find that data field names are not the same on a different stacks and data is not in the required format for a visualisation to display correctly.
