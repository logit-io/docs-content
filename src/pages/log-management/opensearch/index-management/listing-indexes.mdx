# How to list indexes in OpenSearch with Logit.io?

Listing indexes in your OpenSearch cluster is a basic operation that 
allows you to see all available indexes and their status. Follow this 
guide to learn how to list all indexes in your Logit.io hosted OpenSearch service.

## Step 1: Access the OpenSearch Dashboard

Once logged in to Logit.io, navigate to the OpenSearch Dashboards by clicking _Launch Logs_.

## Step 2: Open the Dev Tools

Logit.io's OpenSearch Dashboards provide a Dev Tools feature, which is 
an integrated console for directly executing OpenSearch queries and commands.

In the OpenSearch Dashboards, locate and click on "Dev Tools" on the left-hand navigation bar.

You will be presented with a console where you can input and execute commands.

## Step 3: List All Indexes

To list all indexes in your OpenSearch cluster, you can use the _cat/indices 
API, which provides a human-readable overview of index properties.

In the Dev Tools console, enter the following command to list all indexes:

```cmd copy
GET /_cat/indices?v
```
Press Enter to execute the command.

The v parameter in the command asks for verbose output, 
meaning it will include headers in the output.

This command will display a list of all indexes along with essential 
details such as index names, the number of documents, and the size of the disk.

### Understanding the Output

The output from the _cat/indices command provides several 
pieces of information for each index, including:

- **health:** Indicates the health status of the index (green, yellow, or red).
- **status:** Shows whether the index is open or closed.
- **index:** The name of the index.
- **uuid:** The unique identifier of the index.
- **pri:** The number of primary shards.
- **rep:** The number of replica shards.
- **docs.count:** The number of documents in the index.
- **docs.deleted:** The number of deleted documents in the index.
- **store.size:** The total size taken by the index on disk.
- **pri.store.size:** The size taken by primary shards on disk.
