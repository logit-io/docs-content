# Understanding OpenSearch index templates and how to view them

## What is an OpenSearch index template?

Index templates define settings and mappings that you can automatically 
apply when creating new indices. OpenSearch applies templates to new 
indices based on an index pattern that matches the index name. Index 
templates are only applied during index creation. Changes to index 
templates do not affect existing indices. Settings and mappings specified 
in create index API requests override any settings or mappings 
specified in an index template.

## How can I view the current templates?

There are two ways you can view the current index templates on your Logit.io stacks.

### 1. Using OpenSearch Dashboards Dev tools

One way is to use dev tools in OpenSearch Dashboards. You can access 
OpenSearch Dashboards from any of your stacks by clicking the _Launch Logs_ button.
Once OpenSearch Dashboards has opened you need to open Dev Tools by 
clicking on the wrench icon in the left-hand menu.

In the console section of the screen, we are going to enter the following command.
```plaintext
GET _template
```
You should get an output similar to that of the screenshot below. Here you can 
see all the index templates currently used on this OpenSearch instance.

You can also search for a specific template. For example, if we wanted to see the 
template for the filebeat-* index pattern we can run the following command to return 
only the desired template. We have used a wildcard expression below to return any 
template that contains filebeat-'wildcard'.

```cmd copy
GET _template/filebeat-*
```

This will return a JSON output similar to the screenshot below. Here you can see the following:

- The index template name = filebeat-7.7
- The order of the template = 1 
- The index pattern this template applies to = filebeat-*

### 2. Using the Template Index API

The second way to review the index templates currently in use is to use the index template API. 
To do this you will need your Elasticsearch endpoint address and your ApiKey. 
To access these navigate to `OpenSearch Dashboards Settings` .

The next step is to write a curl -x get command to retrieve the mappings from Elasticsearch. 
In your terminal window, you can run a command similar to the below.

```cmd copy
curl -X GET https://<your-stack-id>-es.logit.io/_template/?apikey=<your-stack-api-key>&pretty
```

This will return a JSON output similar to the screenshot below.

Similar to using Kibana Dev Tools you can also search for a specific template using the index template API. 

To do this you can run a command similar to the below remembering to substitute in your stack ID and stack ApiKey.

```cmd copy
curl -X GET https://<Your-stack-ID>-es.logit.io/_template/filebeat-*/?apikey=<your-stack-ApiKey>&pretty
```

By adding the 'filebeat-*/ ' to the command we can search for only the index templates that contain filebeat-*.
