# Using index patterns to search your logs and metrics with OpenSearch

All logs and metrics that you send to Logit.io belong to an index pattern. 
To search your data with OpenSearch you have to select which OpenSearch index 
or indices that you want to explore. You do this in OpenSearch by 
configuring index patterns.

An index pattern is a string with optional wildcards. It can therefore 
match the name of a single index or include wildcards (*) to match multiple indices.

All new Logit.io stacks come pre-configured with a number of useful 
index patterns to help you get started. To view your index patterns:

1. Select *Dashboard Management* from the left navigation
2. Choose *Index Patterns*

All new Logit.io ELK stacks provide you with default indexes, including:
- -Default
- filebeat-*
- logstash-*
- auditbeat-*
- metricbeat-*
- heartbeat-*
- packetbeat-*

The `filebeat-*` index pattern enables you to search all fields for any 
logs sent to Logit.io using the [Filebeat shipper](/integrations/log-management/shippers/filebeat), 
this is an example of an index pattern matching on a single index.

<Callout type="info">
  When you access OpenSearch for the very first time the default index 
  pattern is set to search log data from all indices being sent to 
  Elasticsearch (a multiple indices match), the pattern is `*-*`.
</Callout>

## Setting up a new index pattern

The *Create Index Pattern* button is found above the list of existing index patterns as shown below:

![Kibana Setup New Pattern](@/images/help/log-management/storage/kibana-setup-new-pattern.png)

Select this and OpenSearch will display the list of indices for which logs are available. 
You will see that the *Next Step* button is disabled and will only become available when 
the specified index name that you have entered matches any indices.

When you are setting up a new index pattern if your index contains one or more 
timestamp fields you will be asked to select one. This is the field that will 
be used to filter your data by time. If you do not wish to filter your search 
by timestamp you can select the *I don't want to use the Time Filter option*.

<Callout type="info">
  You can give fields a timestamp during mapping by using Index Templates,

</Callout>

## Setting a default Index Pattern

If you want the new index pattern to be designated as your default pattern to 
load whenever you select the "Discover" tab then click the favourite star button 
after the index has finished being created. This is located on the top right-hand side of the screen.

Refreshing index patterns
If you add any further index mapping, OpenSearch automatically scans the indices 
that match each pattern to display a list of the new fields. It does not, however, 
automatically pick them up. You can refresh the index pattern to pick up any newly-added fields by:

1. Selecting *Dashboard Management* from the left navigation
2. Choose *Index Patterns*

selecting the index pattern and then clicking the "refresh" icon on the top 
right-hand side of the screen (highlighted below).

![Kibana Refresh Index Patterns](@/images/help/log-management/storage/kibana-refresh-index-patterns.png)

When refreshing you will be prompted to reset the popularity counters for each field. 
OpenSearch keeps track of the fields that you've used the most often and the place 
where this data is stored is called a popularity counter. The data is used to sort 
fields within lists, by refreshing the index pattern this data and ability to sort will be reset.

## Deleting index patterns

To delete an index pattern, select the index from the Index Patterns page and 
then click the "delete" icon on the top right-hand side of the screen (next to 
the default and refresh icons previously mentioned). You can recreate an index 
pattern again at any time in the future but you will also lose all visualisations, 
saved searches, and other saved objects that reference the pattern as well as 
all data in any popularity counters, so be careful!
