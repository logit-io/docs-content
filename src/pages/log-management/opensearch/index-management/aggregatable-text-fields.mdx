# Aggregatable text fields

## Why make a text field aggregatable?

Text fields, by default, are analysed before indexing so that a value like "red car" 
can be found by searching for both "red" and "car". However, you may want to perform 
calculations on words rather than simply search using them and this is where aggregation is useful.

Making a text field aggregatable means that all values of all documents for the text field 
are loaded into memory. This process is called Bucketing.

### What is bucketing?

Bucket aggregations create buckets of documents. In our example of a red car, an 
aggregation on the field will return a "red" bucket and a "car" bucket. Any document 
with a mention of the word red in this text field will be added to the "red" bucket 
and the same for the word car and the "car" bucket. Obviously, if we have lots of words 
in a text field over many documents we will end up with a lot of buckets. Some documents 
will be found in more than one bucket depending on the content of the field whilst others may not.

### What are the benefits?

The benefit is that you are now able to perform calculations on the documents. 
So, for example, if we have another field in our document that contains a country 
we would be able to calculate the number of red cars by country. Perhaps we have 
another field that contains a year. We can work out the average number of red cars 
in a country by year. We can then visualise our calculations using OpenSearch.

  Please remember that aggregating on a text field using fielddata 
  is very expensive because values for all documents of that field 
  are loaded into memory which can cause performance problems.

## How do I check if a field is aggregatable?

To check if a field is aggregatable open OpenSearch choose the *Management* option 
on the left-hand side menu and then choose *index patterns*. If there is a 
check/circle under the aggregatable column then this means the field is aggregated.

## How do I make a field aggregatable?

<Steps>
  ### Select a field

  First, you need to choose a field. For this example I've opted to use 
  the message field, as you can see in the image below the message field is not aggregated.

  Now you need to find out what index pattern this particular message field appears under. 
  As you're on the index pattern page you'll be able to view the index pattern at the top 
  of the page. The Logstash-* index pattern is being used in the example above.

  ### Fetching the templates

  The second part requires the use of the 'OpenSearch Dev Tools' section, select 
  the wrench tool icon on the OpenSearch menu and run the following command in 
  the dev tools section. You can also use the OpenSearch API to get the templates, 
  but in this example you'll be using *'OpenSearch Dev Tools'*.
 
  ```cmd
  GET _cat/templates
  ```

  This will return the names of the templates currently in OpenSearch. 
  The name of the template required in the example is Logstash. So now on 
  a new line in OpenSearch Dev Tools you're going to run the following command.
  
  ```cmd
  GET _template/logstash
  ```

  Running this command will fetch the Logstash index template, as shown below:
  
  ```json
  {
    "order" : 0,
    "version" : 60001,
    "index_patterns" : [
      "logstash-*"
    ],
    "settings" : {
      "index" : {
        "refresh_interval" : "5s"
      }
    },
    "mappings" : {
      "_default_" : {
        "dynamic_templates" : [
          {
            "message_field" : {
              "path_match" : "message",
              "match_mapping_type" : "string",
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "text",
                "norms" : false,
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "string_fields" : {
              "match" : "*",
              "match_mapping_type" : "string",
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "text",
                "norms" : false,
                "fields" : {
                  "keyword" : {
                    "type" : "keyword",
                    "ignore_above" : 256
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "properties" : {
          "@timestamp" : {
            "type" : "date"
          },
          "@version" : {
            "type" : "keyword"
          },
          "geoip" : {
            "dynamic" : true,
            "properties" : {
              "ip" : {
                "type" : "ip"
              },
              "location" : {
                "type" : "geo_point"
              },
              "latitude" : {
                "type" : "half_float"
              },
              "longitude" : {
                "type" : "half_float"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "aliases" : { }
  }
  ```

  ### Creating a keyword field

  In the template above find the "message_field" section. You can see that the current 
  mapping type is text, you can't aggregate on a text field type. 
  You need a keyword field type in order to aggregate.

  The easiest way to change the mapping type of the field is to input a new template. 
  Copy the template above into a text editor and convert the "message_field" to a keyword. 
  You can do this by adding the next code snippet to the message field.
 
  ```json
  "fields" : {
    "keyword" : {
      "ignore_above" : 2048,
      "type" : "keyword"
    }
  }
  ```

  The message field mapping should now look like this:

  ```json
  "mappings" : {
    "_default_" : {
      "dynamic_templates" : [
        {
          "message_field" : {
            "path_match" : "message",
            "match_mapping_type" : "string",
            "mapping" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "norms" : false,
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 2048
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
      mappings __default__ has been deprecated in version 7 and will appear as mappings _doc:

    ```json
    "mappings" : {
      "_doc" : {
        "dynamic_templates" : [ ... ],
      }
    }
    ```
  </Callout>

  You need to set a reasonable size on 'ignore above' so not to impact performance. 
  Most messages are smaller than 1500 characters, but they may grow. In this example 
  you have allowed up to 2048 total characters, longer messages will be ignored.

  ### Changing the template order
  You also need to change the order of the template to make sure it gets applied 
  to the message field. If you change the order number to 4 it will have the highest 
  order number out of all of the templates. 
  
  This means it will be the top-level 
  template that gets applied. The way orders work for templates is that the lowest 
  order number gets applied first and the higher number sits on top of that. 
  
  So a template with an order number 0 would be applied first, then an order number of 1 
  would be applied second, an order number of 4 would sit above both of those and be 
  applied as the top-level template. Go ahead and change the order to have the value of 4.
  
  ```json
  PUT _template/logstash_msg_keyword
  {
    "order" : 4,
    "version" : 60001,
    "index_patterns" : ["logstash-*"]
  }
  ```

  ### Putting a new template into OpenSearch
  Copy the new template as it is ready to be added. Before you paste the template 
  into OpenSearch. You need to first add the following line into 'OpenSearch Dev Tools.' 
  This tells OpenSearch you're going to input a new template and name it *logstash_msg_keyword*.
  
  ```cmd
  PUT _template/logstash_msg_keyword
  ```

  On a new line in 'OpenSearch Dev Tools' paste the new template. 
  You should have something similar to the below section.

  ```json
  PUT _template/logstash_msg_keyword
  {
    "order" : 4,
    "version" : 60001,
    "index_patterns" : [
      "logstash-*"
    ],
    "settings" : {
      "index" : {
        "refresh_interval" : "5s"
      }
    },
    "mappings" : {
      "_default_" : {
        "dynamic_templates" : [
          {
            "message_field" : {
              "path_match" : "message",
              "match_mapping_type" : "string",
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "text",
                "norms" : false,
                "fields" : {
                  "keyword" : {
                    "type" : "keyword",
                    "ignore_above" : 2048
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "string_fields" : {
              "match" : "*",
              "match_mapping_type" : "string",
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "text",
                "norms" : false,
                "fields" : {
                  "keyword" : {
                    "type" : "keyword",
                    "ignore_above" : 256
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "properties" : {
          "@timestamp" : {
            "type" : "date"
          },
          "@version" : {
            "type" : "keyword"
          },
          "geoip" : {
            "dynamic" : true,
            "properties" : {
              "ip" : {
                "type" : "ip"
              },
              "location" : {
                "type" : "geo_point"
              },
              "latitude" : {
                "type" : "half_float"
              },
              "longitude" : {
                "type" : "half_float"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "aliases" : { }
  }
  ```

  ### Send test data with a date in the future
  
  Templates are applied on index creation, as data is likely to already have 
  been sent to the  stack today. You need to use a future index creation. This 
  can be achieved by using a date in the future for example 1/1/2030. You can 
  then use your stacks API key to send data from the command line into the stack. 
  This can be found on the Stack > Settings page of 
  your [Logit.io](https://logit.io/?_gl=1*fysv35*_ga*NzE2MTk2MzcxLjE3MTAyNDM2MTA.*_ga_W546BZYLYM*MTcxODI4NzM3MS4xMTIuMS4xNzE4Mjk3MjE5LjYwLjAuMA..) Dashboard.
  
  ```cmd
  curl -i -H "ApiKey: <your-stack-api-key" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: default" https://api.logit.io/v2 -d '{"message":"Logit.io Test Log", "@timestamp":"2019-11-08T11:00:0.000Z"}'
  ```

  ### Confirm the results

  Once you have confirmed data has arrived into your stack. On OpenSearch you need 
  to go to the Management tab, select index patterns, refresh the index field list 
  and search for the message.keyword field, check whether the field is now aggregatable.
</Steps>
