# What are OpenSearch Mappings?

### What are mappings?
An index mapping specifies the data structure of the data within that index, listing all the fields and their data types.

Importantly a field can only be of *one* type, sending data of another type can result in a mapping conflict and data being rejected.

### How mappings are generated
Mappings can be passed in on index creation, but are usually built from [templates](/log-management/opensearch/index-management/index-templates) and then expanded by data as it's received.

If a field isn't specified in the template (and built into the index's mappings when it was created), then the type will be chosen based on the data when it is seen for the first time by that index.

This can result in issues where inconsistent data is being sent as the first data seen each day is assumed to be the desired type.

### How to view the mappings for an index
To view your mappings you can follow the [article here](/log-management/opensearch/index-management/mapping/viewing-mappings).

### Worked example mapping
A very short example of index mapping is displayed and commented below;

```json copy showLineNumbers

  "logstash-1970.01.01": {              # Index name we're looking at 
    "mappings": {

        "properties": {
          "@timestamp": {               # The @timestamp field is of
            "type": "date"              # date format allowing for
                                        # time based searching, 
                                        # eg betweeen 10:00am and 
                                        # 11:00am

          },

              }                         # would probably have been
