# Mapping IP Address Info to geo_point Fields

In OpenSearch, you can use Logstash to map IP address data to `geo_point` fields. 
Just add the following to your [Logstash filters](/log-management/ingestion-pipeline/configuration/configure-logstash-filters).

## Example Logstash Configuration

```ruby copy
if [ip] {
    geoip {
        source => "ip"
        target => "[source][geo]"
    }
    
    geoip {
        source => "ip"
        target => "[source][as]"
        default_database_type => "ASN"
        fields => [ "AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM_NUMBER", "AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM_ORGANIZATION"]
    }
}
```

## Configuration Details

- Replace `[ip]` with the actual name of the field in your data that contains IP addresses.
- The first `geoip` filter enriches the document with geographical information.
- The second `geoip` filter enriches the document with Autonomous System (AS) information.

Make sure to configure the source and target fields according to your 
data structure. The `fields` parameter in the second `geoip` filter 
specifies which AS-related fields to include in the output.

### After Configuring Logstash

Your documents will be enriched with geographical and AS information, 
and you can index them into OpenSearch. Then, in OpenSearch Dashboards, 
you can create visualizations and dashboards using the mapped `geo_point` fields.

Remember to adjust the Logstash input and output configurations 
based on your specific data sources and destination requirements.
