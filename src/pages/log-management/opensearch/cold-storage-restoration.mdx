# How To Use Cold Storage For Logit.io Stacks & Restore Data.

When using Logit.io, you have the capability to archive your data to your 
Amazon S3 cold storage or to cold storage on Logit.io. This functionality 
is useful for organizations looking to efficiently manage their log and 
event data while ensuring long-term accessibility and compliance.

Cold storage is an ideal solution for handling data that you need to 
retain for compliance, historical analysis, or backup purposes, but 
which is not frequently accessed. This is a cost-effective storage 
option that helps you save on storage costs when compared to 
keeping all your data “hot” within a hosted service.

As many industries and regulatory frameworks require organizations to 
maintain logs and event data for extended periods. Archiving data to 
S3 cold storage ensures that your organization can comply with these 
requirements without incurring high storage costs. It also provides 
peace of mind, knowing that your data is safely stored and readily 
available when needed for auditing or compliance purposes.

To get started with sending your data to S3 from Logit.io you will 
need to reach out to support via our live chat, from here we will 
be able to assist you with your cold storage needs.

Logit.io also offers the flexibility of restoring your archived data 
to any of your Logit.io stacks. This is particularly useful for 
organizations with multiple environments, such as development, 
staging, and production stacks.

Logit.io offers a straightforward solution for cold data restoration 
within your stack, with manual support provided during investigations 
and audits. Our support team can assist in efficiently managing the 
process, ensuring the seamless retrieval of archived data as needed.
