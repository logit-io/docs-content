# Disabling the searching of a field in OpenSearch using Index Templates

You may have noticed that OpenSearch automatically tries to index all 
of the fields given to it. However, sometimes you will find that 
you want to just store a field without indexing it.

### A short description of mapping

In OpenSearch, defining settings and mappings that determine how fields 
should be analysed is done using Index Templates. These templates are 
automatically applied as new indices are created.

Using mapping we can define how a document, including the fields it contains, are stored and indexed.

### Mapping definitions

- Which string fields should be treated as full-text fields.
- Which fields contain numbers, dates, or geolocations.
- Whether the values of all fields in the document should be indexed into the catch-all `_all` field.
- The format of date values.
- Custom rules to control the mapping for dynamically added fields.

### A simple example of mapping being specified when creating an index

Here we are creating an index called `my_index` with a mapping type called `doc`. 
For each field we have specified a `type`.

```json copy
PUT my_index 
{
  "mappings": {
    "doc": { 
      "properties": { 
        "title":    { "type": "text"  }, 
        "name":     { "type": "text"  }, 
        "age":      { "type": "integer" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can see that title will be a text field, name will also be a text 
field and age will be an integer field. As well as being able to 
specify the type of the field there are other properties that 
we can map, one of these is called enabled.

### Excluding fields using mapping

In the above example we may want to index the name and age of the 
person but never have a need to query the title. When set to false, 
the enabled setting causes OpenSearch to skip the parsing of the 
contents of a field entirely. In order to do this with our example, 
we would update the title property as follows.

### An example of using the enabled property type.

```json copy
PUT my_index 
{
  "mappings": {
    "doc": { 
      "properties": { 
        "title":    { "enabled": false  }, 
        "name":     { "type": "text"  }, 
        "age":      { "type": "integer" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the title field is now disabled. Data can still be 
sent to the title field, the JSON can still be retrieved from the `_source field`, 
but it is not searchable or stored in any other way.

The template can be sent to OpenSearch using the following curl command:

```cmd copy
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"mappings": {"doc":{"properties":{"title":{"enabled": false}, "name":{"type": "text"}, "age":{ "type": "integer" }}}}}' https://your-username:your-password@your-endpoint-address/my_index
```

Your username, password and endpoint address can be found on your Logit.io 
Dashboard, just choose settings for the required Stack. Select the 
OpenSearch Settings menu and your endpoint is listed in the OpenSearch Access section.

  Index templates are only applied at Index creation time. This means
