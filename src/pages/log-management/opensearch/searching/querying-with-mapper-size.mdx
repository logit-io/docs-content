# How to query OpenSearch to find large log messages

The "mapper-size" plugin allows you to track the size of documents in your 
OpenSearch indices. Here's how you can enable it and query for large log messages:

### Enable "mapper-size" Plugin

Before you can query for large log messages, you need to enable the "mapper-size" 
plugin for your OpenSearch indices. You can do this by updating the 
mapping of your index. In the OpenSearch Dev Tools console, run the following command:

```json
PUT your-index-name
{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "_size": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}

```
Replace your-index-name with the actual name of your log index. This command enables the "mapper-size" for that specific index.

### Query for Large Log Messages:
Now that "mapper-size" is enabled, you can query for large log messages. 
You can use OpenSearch's Discover or Visualize feature to create a 
search for large log messages. Here's an example OpenSearch Query DSL 
for finding log messages larger than a specific size (e.g., 1MB):

```json
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "_size": {
        "gte": 1000000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return log messages with a size greater than or equal to 1MB. 
You can adjust the value (1,000,000 in this example) to fit your specific size threshold.

### Save and Visualize:
After creating your query, you can save it in OpenSearch and create visualizations or dashboards to monitor large log messages effectively.

By following these steps, you can enable the "mapper-size" plugin, configure your index to track document sizes and create queries in OpenSearch to find and analyze large log messages in your OpenSearch indices.

### Daily Ingestion

If you wanted to have the size field available for all ingested data going forward then you would need to make some changes to the index templates, for example:

```json
PUT _template/your-template-name
{
  "order": 5,
  "index_patterns": ["filebeat-*"],
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "_size": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
