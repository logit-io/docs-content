# Managing OpenSearch Reporting

### OpenSearch Reporting Introduction
The OpenSearch Reporting feature lets you generate and schedule reports 
for *dashboards, visualisations and saved searches* and output them to 
CSV, png and pdf. You can create reports from *Discovery, Visualise, or Dashboard* views.

In addition, you can also create reports using Report definitions and 
schedule these to be generated automatically at periodic intervals.

  To use and generate new reports, you must have at least the 
  `stack_user` [OpenSearch Security](/account-administration/account-access-users-teams/roles-access/managing-opensearch-grafana-security-roles) role.

### On-demand Reports
On-demand reports let you quickly generate a report from the current view. 
From  *Discovery, Visualise, or Dashboard* views choose **Reporting** from the top menu.

For dashboards or visualisations choose **Download PDF** or **Download PNG**. 
From the Discover view, save your search and then choose **Download CSV**. 
Depending on the size of the report, it might take a few minutes but the reports 
generate asynchronously and you will see a notification when your report is ready.

<Callout type="info">
  When using a data table or visualisation to generate a png or pdf report, 
  it's important to set the **Max rows per page** option to ensure that the generated 
  report includes all the required data.

### Report Definitions
Report definitions allow you to generate reports on a pre-defined schedule. 
To create a new report definition choose **Reporting** from the left menu in OpenSearch. 
If you can't see this option you may need to speak to your account Administrator, 
to find out who this is choose **Help and Support** from your Logit.io dashboard. 

Choose **Create** to generate a new reporting definition

![Create Report Definition](@/images/help/log-management/storage/create-report-definition.png)

Enter a name and optional description for your report, choose the report source 
which can be an existing dashboard, visualisation or saved search and then 
specify a time range for the required data.

If you choose to schedule your report, you can either select **recurring** 
or **cron based** on your requirements. 
Using [Cron](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/alerting/cron/) expressions 
gives you more flexibility about when exactly to generate the report.

Choose **create** to save the report definition.

Depending on how you have configured your report definition, the report will be created in the Reports window. 
You can then choose the link under the generate column to download the CSV, png or pdf report.
