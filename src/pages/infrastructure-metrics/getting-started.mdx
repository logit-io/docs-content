# Get Started Sending Metric Data

<Callout type="info">
  To successfully use this guide, you need to have already created a Logit.io account and Infrastructure Metrics stack. If you haven't, please click [here](/getting-started) to continue
</ Callout>
You can send data to your Infrastructure Metrics service in a few seconds by following this guide.

*Note*: this guide assumes you have curl installed on your computer. It is provided by default on most Linux distributions and in macOS and Windows 10 / 11. 
To install on earlier versions of Windows you can follow the instructions [here](https://curl.se/windows/). 

If you are logged in, the endpoint address you need to send data to us will be pre-populated. If you are not logged in please do so and return to this guide.

We are going to send three curl requests with some dummy metric data to your Infrastructure Metrics enddpoint. This guide is an adapted version of the  
VictoriaMetrics documentation [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-import-csv-data).

### Where to start...

Click on the button below to open Grafana.

<LaunchVisualizer />

In Grafana, click on Explore in the side menu and in the Metric drop-down select 'ask' ![Metric drop-down](@/images/getting-started/metrics/grafana-metric1.png)
and then the blue 'Run query' button in the top-right of the Window ![Run query button](@/images/getting-started/metrics/grafana-metric2.png)

<Callout type="info">
  This guide is intended to familiarise you with quickly sending some data to Logit.io
  and viewing it in Grafana. It is unlikely to be the method you will choose to 
  send your real metric data to us - we have various data source integration guides to help 
  you send metrics from a variety of sources.
</Callout>

### Confirm data is in Grafana

Having followed the instructions we should now be able to view the 
metrics in Grafana. To do this choose Launch Dashboard in Step 5 
of the integration guide or from your main dashboard choose Launch Metrics.

![Launch Buttons](@/images/help/infrastructure-metrics/launch-buttons.png)

When Grafana is launched you should be able to see the metrics that were ingested into 
OpenSearch via the ingestion pipeline. It is possible to filter this data by time, 
fields, and content, so feel free to explore!

### Troubleshooting?

If you don't see any metrics in Grafana then there are a few things that you should check.

While setting up the Telegraf for system metrics monitoring, you may encounter 
issues with data visibility. If your collected data is not appearing as expected 
in Victoria Metrics or Grafana, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

**Telegraf Configuration Validation:**

Syntax Errors: Double-check your Telegraf configuration file for syntax errors 
or typos. A minor mistake can prevent Telegraf from collecting and transmitting data.

**Output Plugin Configuration:**

Output Plugin Settings: Review the configuration of the Telegraf output 
plugin responsible for sending data to Victoria Metrics. 
Ensure that the remote write URL is correctly configured.

**Firewall and Network Issues:**

Firewall Rules: Verify that your firewall settings allow outbound connections 
from the host running Telegraf. Check for any network issues that might be 
preventing data transmission. 
This [help article](/log-management/troubleshooting/how-can-i-diagnose-no-data-appearing) 
contains some useful firewall commands that may help. 

**Remote Write URL:**

Remote Write URL Validity: Confirm that the remote write URL specified in 
Telegraf matches the one provided. A mismatched URL can prevent data from 
reaching the correct destination.

# How do I load and view dashboards in my Metrics Stack

To access dashboards within your metrics stack, start by navigating to the 
Logit.io dashboard. Once you're on the Logit.io dashboard, scroll down until 
you locate the 'Infrastructure Metrics' section. Simply click on 'Launch' 
next to 'Grafana' under the 'Services' section. This will take you to Grafana, 
where you can analyse and interact with your metrics data.

![Infrastructure Metrics](@/images/help/infrastructure-metrics/infrastructure-metrics-stack.png)

Within Grafana, you can kickstart your journey into visualizing your 
metrics by choosing "New Dashboard" from the menu on the left-hand side.

![Grafana Dashboards](@/images/help/infrastructure-metrics/dashboards.png)

On the following screen, you have the option to include a new panel 
on your dashboard, allowing you to initiate the display of graphs 
linked to the metrics sent to your Grafana instance.

![New Dashboard](@/images/help/infrastructure-metrics/new-dashboard.png)

The subsequent example illustrates the screen that appears after selecting the 
option to add a new panel. After customizing the graph to showcase the specific 
metrics you want to measure, simply click "Apply" to 
preserve this new panel as part of your new dashboard.

![Edit Dashboard Panel](@/images/help/infrastructure-metrics/edit-dashboard-panel.png)

From here, you can proceed to include additional panels that showcase the 
essential metrics you want to monitor consistently.

To access pre existing dashboards, start from the initial screen dashboard's 
menu, and choose "Browse" to view the dashboards currently accessible, 
depending on your account's permission level.
