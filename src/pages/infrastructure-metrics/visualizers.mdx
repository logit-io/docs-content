# What are Grafana Dashboards/Visualizations?

Grafana offers various visualizations, which present data on your dashboards. 
Dashboards are a core feature of the Grafana open-source monitoring and 
observability platform. These dashboards are user-customizable interfaces 
that display visualizations of data from various sources, making it easier 
to monitor, analyze, and gain insights into systems, applications, and infrastructure.

## Working with Visualizers/Grafana Dashboards
To locate Infrastructure Metrics Visualizers, from the initial dashboard, 
scroll down to find 'Infrastructure Metrics', to the right of this section 
you will find the 'Visualizations' card. Here you can utilize dashboards to 
gain insights from your metrics data, allowing you to visualize, explore, 
and comprehend the information necessary for well-informed decision-making. 

Also, you can view your visualization in the Grafana tool by selecting 'Launch' next to 'Grafana' under 'Services'.

## Infrastructure Metrics: Visualizers/Grafana Dashboards

From here you can view your Grafana nodes and the individual instances, 
including the health and size of each. 

This makes it easier to manage and monitor complex environments. Another 
advantage is that Grafana allows users to create custom metrics and visualizations. 
This flexibility is valuable for tailoring monitoring to the specific 
requirements of an organization.

Once you have selected “launch metrics” at the top of the overview page 
you will be able to generate your first dashboard in order to visualize 
your data. In Grafana from the left-hand menu you can select “new dashboard” 
to get started with visualizing your data for the first time:

From the next screen you can add a new panel to your dashboard to begin 
viewing the graphs associated with the data being forwarded to your Grafana instance:

The following example displays the next screen you will see once you have 
selected to add a new panel, once you have adjusted the graph to display the 
metrics that you wish to measure simply select “apply” to save this new panel 
as part of your dashboard:

From here you can continue to add more panels that display the key metrics you 
wish to view on an ongoing basis.
