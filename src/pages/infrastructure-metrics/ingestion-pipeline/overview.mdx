# Infrastructure Metrics: Ingestion Pipeline

An Infrastructure Metrics Ingestion Pipeline is a system designed to collect, 
process, and store metrics and performance data from various components of an 
organization's IT infrastructure. This ingestion pipeline is a crucial part of 
monitoring and managing the health and performance of IT systems and services.

## Working with Infrastructure Metrics: Ingestion Pipeline

The Infrastructure Metrics Ingestion Pipeline can be found from the initial 
dashboard. First, scroll down to Infrastructure Metrics as shown above, 
which is normally found after 'Log Management'. Here you'll find three 
cards, the one on the left is the 'Ingestion Pipeline.'

With the Ingestion Pipeline, optimize your data processing pipeline with 
VM Agents, allowing you to tailor the way you extract data. Also, you can 
view the health of VM Agent nodes. By clicking the ellipses at the top 
right of the ingestion pipeline card you will open a menu that will 
show you an option to 'Edit Scrape Config'.

## Edit Scrape Config

By selecting 'Edit Scrape Config' from the dropdown menu you will be taken 
to a page where you can add configuration for your Victoria Metrics Agent.

## VM Agent Nodes

In the context of VictoriaMetrics, "nodes" typically refer to instances or 
servers that are part of a VictoriaMetrics cluster or deployment. These 
nodes work together to store and query time series data efficiently. The 
individual instances can be viewed here, as well as their health and memory details.
