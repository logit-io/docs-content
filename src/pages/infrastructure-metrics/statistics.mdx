# Statistics

## What are Infrastructure Metrics Usage Statistics?

Infrastructure metrics usage statistics refer to data and information 
about the utilization and performance of various components and resources 
in an IT infrastructure. These specific Usage Statistics for 
Infrastructure Metrics relate to the data sent to your Metrics Stack. 

Understanding how ingestion is calculated, managing active metrics, and 
being aware of the associated costs are vital for effectively using your 
Metrics platform. By staying informed about these metrics, you can optimize 
your usage, control expenses, and gain valuable insights into your 
application's performance.

## Working with  Statistics

To view your Infrastructure Metrics Usage Statistics, from the initial dashboard, 
scroll down until you reach the Infrastructure Metrics section. From here, in 
the top right, you will see a _Statistics_ button. Clicking this will take 
you to the Usage Statistics page. Also, you can find usage statistics from 
the menu on the left-hand side of your screen. You'll see the heading 
'Infrastructure Metrics' under this you click `Statistics` settings which will 
take you to the same 'Usage Statistics' page.

On the "Usage Statistics" page, you can view Metrics data usage statistics, including:
- **Today:** See your Metrics data usage for Today, including Active Metrics, Metrics per Minute and an overview of your percentage used based on your selected plan.
- **Breakdown by Days:** See how your Metrics data usage has evolved over the past days.
- **Historic Usage:** Get insights into your Metrics data usage for up to a year's worth of records.

Scroll down to find a detailed daily breakdown of Metrics usage. This section provides the following information:
- **Active Metrics:**  Active metrics represent the maximum number of active time series with values inserted during a given time of day. For instance, if you're scraping metrics every 15 seconds, for example, if you are sending metrics every 15s, your metrics per minute is approximately x4 that value, but it's also very possible not all sources will be sending every 15s.
- **Metrics Per Minute:** The rate at which metrics are being sent, measured in metrics per minute.
- **Usage Percentage:** A percentage representing your current Metrics data usage in comparison to your plan limits.

## Plan Limits

It's important to note that your Metrics usage should align with your plan 
limits to avoid any overage charges or service interruptions.
