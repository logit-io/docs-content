# Infrastructure Metrics Overview

## What is an Infrastructure Metrics Stack?

In the context of Infrastructure Metrics on Logit.io a stack refers to a collection or 
set of software tools, services, and components that work together to monitor and 
manage various aspects of an IT infrastructure.

Regarding the Ingestion Pipeline this is the entry point of the stack where data is 
collected from various sources. It includes components for data collection, such as 
metrics shippers, data connectors, or APIs, that bring data into the pipeline. Here 
you can utilise VM Agents to collect your metrics from a variety of different sources, 
as well as view your individual VM Agent Instances and its health and size.

For the Storage section, after processing, the data needs to be stored. This layer 
includes databases, data warehouses, data lakes, or other storage solutions where 
processed data is persisted for future retrieval and analysis. Here, you can utilise 
VM Agents to collect and store your metrics from a variety of different sources, as 
well as view your individual VM Agent Instances and its health, size, and number of cores.

Finally, in reference to Visualizers, to make data insights accessible and understandable, 
visualization tools and libraries are used to create charts, graphs, dashboards, and 
reports. These visualizations can be interactive and provide a user-friendly interface for 
exploring data. Here you can employ Grafana dashboards to produce interactive, customizable 
visual displays that provide insights and real-time monitoring of data from various sources. 
Also, you can view your Grafana nodes and their individual instances.

## Working with your stack in Infrastructure Metrics

To locate your Infrastructure Metrics stack in Logit.io, from the initial dashboard scroll 
down to find Infrastructure Metrics, from here you can view your entire stack. There's a 
lot of information in this section, so to support you we have broken this down. 

## Stack Plan

To begin with, directly below the application performance monitoring heading you'll find 
'stack plan.' This will detail your stack details and subscription, including how many 
spans per month and the retention time period.

## Remote Write

Beneath Stack Plan is the heading 'Services'. The first of the two 'Services' is 
'Remote Write'. Here you can copy the endpoint to send metrics from a remote system.

## Grafana

The second option under 'Services' is 'Grafana'. From here you can copy your Grafana 
endpoint. or select 'launch' which will take you to your Grafana dashboard homepage.

## View Data Integrations

Towards the top right of the Infrastructure Metrics section you will find 'View Data Integrations.' 
Clicking this link will take you to our source integration tool. This tool has a wide variety 
of source integrations available for you to use in Logit.io, with detailed and easy-to-follow 
instructions to seamlessly integrate your data into the platform.

## View Statistics

To the right of 'view data integrations' you'll find 'view statistics.' Clicking this link 
will take you to a detailed page that will give you access to details about your stack 
data usage and utilization. Additionally, historical usage data for up to one year's worth 
of records is available. For a more comprehensive analysis of these patterns, the usage 
table located at the bottom of this page provides a detailed breakdown. It illustrates 
daily trends in active metrics, metrics sent per minute, and your existing data plan limits.

## Manage Stack in Infrastructure Metrics

Lastly, to the far right of the APM section, you will find the 'manage stack' button. 
This page provides access to your Metrics Stack version details, allowing you to 
either rebuild or remove your Stack as needed.
