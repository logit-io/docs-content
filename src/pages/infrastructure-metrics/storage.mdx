# What is Infrastructure Metrics Storage?

Infrastructure metrics storage refers to the storage and management of data 
related to the performance and health of an organisation's IT infrastructure. 
This data typically includes a wide range of metrics and measurements collected 
from various components of the infrastructure, such as servers, networking 
devices, storage systems, and cloud resources. Infrastructure metrics storage 
serves several purposes, including monitoring, troubleshooting, capacity planning, 
and ensuring the overall reliability and efficiency of IT operations.

## Working with Infrastructure Metrics Storage

From your dashboard scroll down to find 'Infrastructure Metrics.' Navigate 
towards the middle card between 'Ingestion Pipeline' and 'Visualizers' to

## Victoria Metric Nodes

VictoriaMetrics is an open-source, high-performance, and cost-effective 
monitoring and time-series database system that is often used for storing 
and querying time-series data, such as metrics and logs, in a distributed environment. 

In VictoriaMetrics, the term nodes refers to the individual instances 
or containers that make up a VictoriaMetrics cluster or deployment. 
For your Victoria Metrics Nodes, you can inspect the current version, 
and view each individual instance and its health, size and number of cores.
