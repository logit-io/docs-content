# How to configure RAM usage alerts with Logit.io?

RAM usage alerts are a critical component of proactive system management. 
They provide insights into system performance, resource allocation, security, 
and cost control, enabling organizations to optimize their IT infrastructure, 
enhance user experiences, and ensure the reliability and security of their systems.

In the steps below, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a RAM 
usage alert rule in Grafana. This rule will monitor the RAM usage of your 
servers and notify you when it exceeds a certain threshold, which could 
indicate inadequate memory allocation. While this is a specific example, 
the process for setting up other alert rules in Grafana will follow a similar pattern.

## Pre-requisites

Configure Contact Points

## New Alert Rule

Grafana has an entire section dedicated to alerts. In the main dashboard, 
find and select the Alerts section. Here, you'll see an option for 'New Alert Rule.' 
When you select this, you'll be taken to a new screen where you can set up your alert. 
This is where you'll specify what conditions must be met for the alert to be triggered.

## Select a Metric

A metric in this context is a measurement that your system is tracking. 
You might track many metrics, such as RAM usage, CPU usage, network traffic, 
etc. Here, you're selecting 'ram_usage' which represents how much RAM is being 
used. This metric can help you understand if your system is running low on memory.

In this step, you're also choosing which instances of your metric to apply the 
alert rule to. For example, if you're monitoring several servers, 'host' could 
be a label that indicates which server the RAM data is coming from. You can 
also set the comparison to '=~', which means you'll be able to use regex 
(regular expressions) to match multiple hosts based on patterns. If you have 
multiple servers sending RAM data, you can either select one specific server 
or use a regex to select multiple servers that match a pattern.

## Change the Function

This step is about choosing how the metric value is calculated. By default, 
Grafana uses the 'last()' function, which means it only looks at the most 
recent data point. By changing it to 'avg()', you're telling Grafana to 
calculate the average value over a certain period of time. This can help 
prevent alerts from being triggered by brief spikes in RAM usage.

We can choose the limit that triggers the alert. If you set "IS ABOVE" to 90, 
then the alert will be triggered when the average RAM usage goes above 90%. 
This means you'll be notified if your RAM is utilized more than 90% of the 
time, which could indicate inadequate memory.

## Alert Evaluation

This step determines how often Grafana checks whether the alert conditions 
are met. By default, Grafana checks every minute. But you can change this 
to check less frequently, say every 5 minutes if you don't need real-time alerting.

## Additional Labels

Here, you're adding more conditions to your alert rule. You're adding the labels 
'ram' and 'ram-total', which could correspond to other metrics related to RAM usage. 
By adding these conditions, you're saying the alert should also 
consider these metrics, not just the RAM usage.

## Name and Group the Alert

It's important to keep your alerts organized, especially if you have a 
lot of them. By giving the alert a name and categorizing it under a 
specific folder and group, you can easily find and manage it later.

## Set Notifications

This step is about deciding how you'll be notified when the alert is triggered. 
You can label the alert as 'severity=warning', which tells you and your team 
that this is a warning level alert. You also need to set up a notification 
channel, such as email or Slack, through which you will receive the alert notifications.

## Save the Alert Rule

After you've set up the alert rule to your satisfaction, the final step is 
to save it. Once saved, Grafana will start monitoring the specified metric 
and trigger the alert if the conditions you set are met.
