# Getting Started With OpenTelemetry for Logs

Logit.io provides extensive features and configurations to ingest, 
monitor, and analyze data, manage your infrastructure and so much more!

Follow this quickstart guide to send log data using the OpenTelemetry collector. 

## Pre-requisites

You'll need a Logit.io account. Sign up for a free trial [here](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-up?utm_source=GettingStartedGuideOpenTelemetryMetrics&utm_medium=SignUp).

## Step 1: Get your data into Logit.io

Your data analytics journey starts by sending your Logs, Metrics or 
Traces to Logit.io. For this purpose, we will be using the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
This choice enables you to quickly and securely ship your data. The OpenTelemetry 
Collector offers a vendor-agnostic way to collect, process, and export telemetry 
data, ensuring compatibility and flexibility across different monitoring tools and services.

## Set up your data source

3. After you have installed and configured the OpenTelemetry Collector return to your 
dashboard [https://dashboard.logit.io](https://dashboard.logit.io)

4. From your dashboard choose Launch Logs.

## Step 2: Verify and Search your Data

As OpenSearch Dashboards launches, which serves as the default log viewer, you 
will be prompted the first time to "Select your tenant." For most users, 
selecting the "Global" tenant is the recommended option.

  You can always change the tenant later in your user settings inside of OpenSearch.

**The Discover View**

After selecting your tenant, you are then redirected to the Discover View 
that allows you to explore and search the data arriving in your stack. It 
provides a user-friendly interface to quickly filter and find specific logs, 
metrics, or other data types.

## Step 3: Monitor and Troubleshoot

You can view your data with **predefined searches and dashboards** that 
facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.

Once you've sent your logs to Logit.io, you can gain an in-depth perspective 
on the health and performance of your distributed cloud services through 
using real-time monitoring, and custom dashboards. This allows your team to 
dive deep into logs for troubleshooting, while simultaneously offering a 
broad view of your infrastructure's status via custom dashboards and notifications.
