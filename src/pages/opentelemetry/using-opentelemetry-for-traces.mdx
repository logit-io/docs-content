# Getting Started With OpenTelemetry for Traces

Logit.io provides extensive features and configurations to ingest, 
monitor, and analyze data, manage your infrastructure and so much more!

Follow this quickstart guide to send metrics data using the OpenTelemetry collector.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need a Logit.io account. Sign up for a free 
trial [here](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-up?utm_source=GettingStartedGuideOpenTelemetryMetrics&utm_medium=SignUp).

## Step 1: Get your data into Logit.io

Your data analytics journey starts by sending your Logs, Metrics or Traces 
to Logit.io. For this purpose, we will be using the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
This choice enables you to quickly and securely ship your data. 

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic way to collect, 
process, and export telemetry data, ensuring compatibility and 
flexibility across different monitoring tools and services.

## Set up your data source

**Traces OpenTelemetry Collector**

1. Login to Logit.io

2. Initiate the configuration process by clicking on _View Data Integrations_.

3. After you have installed and configured the OpenTelemetry Collector return to your dashboard https://dashboard.logit.io

4. From your dashboard choose Launch APM.

## Step 2: Verify and Search your Data

As Jaeger launches, which serves as the default Trace viewer, you are redirected to the SearchView.

**The Search View**

The Search View in Jaeger enables the exploration and analysis of your 
stack's incoming trace data. It provides an intuitive interface for quickly 
identifying specific traces, pinpointing errors, or examining varied 
trace information and metadata.

## Step 3: Investigate and Troubleshoot

To investigate a trace in greater detail, click on a trace summary in Jaeger's Overview. 
This action allows for an in-depth examination of a trace's span durations and operational 
flow, essential for diagnosing issues and optimizing system performance.

Once you've sent your traces to Logit.io, you can gain an in-depth perspective 
on the health and performance of your distributed cloud services through using 
real-time monitoring, and custom dashboards. This allows your team to dive deep 
into logs for troubleshooting, while simultaneously offering a broad view of 
your infrastructure's status via custom dashboards and notifications.
