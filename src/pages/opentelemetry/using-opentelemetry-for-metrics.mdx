# Getting Started With OpenTelemetry for Metrics

Logit.io provides extensive features and configurations to ingest, 
monitor, and analyze data, manage your infrastructure and so much more!

Follow this quickstart guide to send metrics data using the OpenTelemetry collector.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need a Logit.io account. Sign up for a free 
trial [here](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-up?utm_source=GettingStartedGuideOpenTelemetryMetrics&utm_medium=SignUp).

## Step 1: Get your data into Logit.io

Your data analytics journey starts by sending your Logs, Metrics or Traces to 
Logit.io. For this purpose, we will be using the OpenTelemetry Collector. This 
choice enables you to quickly and securely ship your data. The OpenTelemetry 
Collector offers a vendor-agnostic way to collect, process, and export telemetry 
data, ensuring compatibility and flexibility across different monitoring tools and services.

Once you've sent your metrics to Logit.io, you can gain an in-depth perspective 
on the health and performance of your distributed cloud services through using 
real-time monitoring, and custom dashboards. This allows your team to dive deep 
into logs for troubleshooting, while simultaneously offering a broad view of 
your infrastructure's status via custom dashboards and notifications.
