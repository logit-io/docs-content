## Creating an OpenSearch Cluster

This article describes how to provision an OpenSearch cluster using Logit.io.

<Steps>
  ### Add Hosted OpenSearch
  
  <AddOpenSearchStack/>

   ### Configure Stack

  You will be presented with your configuration options. Choose a configuration that matches your performance and pricing requirements. 
  Logit.io assign you at least 2 cluster nodes which ensures that the nodes are allocated across different racks within a data centre 
  and also that the allocation is evenly distributed. We do this to ensures stability, fault tolerance and consistent performance.

  ### Stack Summary

  On the right hand side of the page you will see a summary, in this case as we are only adding a Hosted OpenSearch Stack we see just a 
  summary for that. Once you have reviewed the details and pricing and are happy that it meets your requirements click the 'Add Stack' 
  button to create your OpenSearch Cluster.

  Your will be returned to your Logit.io dashboard and that's it. You have now finished creating your OpenSearch Cluster and it is ready 
  for use.

  The Hosted OpenSearch will be visible on your Logit.io Dashboard, you may have to scroll to find it if you have several Stacks already set up on 
  your account.
