## Connect to an OpenSearch Cluster with cURL

This article assumes that you have already created an OpenSearch Cluster, if you have not yet done this then 
please see this guide to create to create a cluster:

[Creating an OpenSearch Cluster](creating-opensearch-cluster.mdx)

Here's a curl example of sending logs to OpenSearch. This method directly interacts with the __OpenSearch REST API__.

<Steps>

### cURL Code Example

  ```cmd copy /@elasticsearch.endpointAddress/ /@elasticsearch.username/ /@elasticsearch.password/
  curl -X POST "@elasticsearch.endpointAddress/logit-example-2025.02.17/_doc/" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -u @elasticsearch.username:@elasticsearch.password ^
  -d ^
  "{ \"@timestamp\": \"2025-02-18T11:54:09.7667466+00:00\", ^
  \"level\": \"INFO\", ^
  \"message\": \"This is a log message from curl\", ^
  \"service\": \"example-service\" ^
  }"
  ```
  
  ### Key Points

  OpenSearch Client: The opensearch-py client handles the connection, authentication, and indexing.

  Headers:
  * Content-Type: application/json: Indicates the payload format.
  * -u @elasticsearch.username:@elasticsearch.password: Provides basic authentication.

  Payload:
  * timestamp: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp (e.g., 2025-01-30T12:34:56Z).
  * level: Log level (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
  * message: The log message.
  * service: (Optional) Specify the source of the log.

  ### Example Output

  OpenSearch will respond with a status indicating that the document was indexed.

  ```json
    {
      "_index": "logit-example",
      "_type": "_doc",
      "_id": "123456",
      "_version": 1,
      "result": "created",
      "_shards": {
        "total": 2,
        "successful": 1,
        "failed": 0
      },
      "_seq_no": 1,
      "_primary_term": 1
    }
  ```

  ### Verifying Logs

  To verify that the log was indexed, you can query the index using curl.

  ```bash copy /@elasticsearch.endpointAddress/ /@elasticsearch.username/ /@elasticsearch.password/
    curl -X GET "@elasticsearch.endpointAddress/logit-example/_search?pretty=true" \
    -u @elasticsearch.username:@elasticsearch.password
  ```

  This will return all documents in the __logit-example__ index.
