## Connect to an OpenSearch Cluster with C#

This article assumes that you have already created an OpenSearch Cluster, if you have not yet done this then 
please see this guide to create a cluster:

[Creating an OpenSearch Cluster](../creating-opensearch-cluster.mdx)

Here's a C# example of sending logs to OpenSearch, this example uses the Serilog logging library and the 
Serilog.Sinks.OpenSearch package in a Console Application. 

<Steps>
  ### Install NuGet Packages

  * Install Serilog

  * Install Serilog.Sinks.OpenSearch

  ```bash copy
  dotnet add package Serilog
  dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.OpenSearch
  ```

  ### C# Code Example

  ```csharp copy filename="program.cs" /@opensearch.endpointAddress/ /@opensearch.username/ /@opensearch.password/
  using Serilog;
  using Serilog.Sinks.OpenSearch;
  using System;

  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          // OpenSearch configuration
          var openSearchUri = "@opensearch.endpointAddress:9200";
          var username = "@opensearch.username";
          var password = "@opensearch.password";

          // Configure Serilog
          Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
              .Enrich.FromLogContext()
              .WriteTo.Console() // Optional: log to console
              .WriteTo.OpenSearch(new OpenSearchSinkOptions(new Uri(openSearchUri))
              {
                  ModifyConnectionSettings = x => x.BasicAuthentication(username, password),
                  AutoRegisterTemplate = true, // Automatically register index template
                  IndexFormat = $"logit-example-{DateTime.Now:yyyy.MM.dd}", // Daily index
                  TypeName = null, // For OpenSearch 2.x and above, this should be null
                  EmitEventFailure = EmitEventFailureHandling.WriteToSelfLog | EmitEventFailureHandling.RaiseCallback,
                  FailureCallback = e => Console.WriteLine($"Failed to log to OpenSearch: {e.Exception}")
              })
              .CreateLogger();

          try
          {
              // Log some messages
              Log.Information("This is an information log");
              Log.Warning("This is a warning log");
              Log.Error("This is an error log");
          }
          catch (Exception ex)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"Exception occurred: {ex.Message}");
          }
          finally
          {
              // Dispose the logger
              Log.CloseAndFlush();
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ### Key Points

  The IndexFormat is customizable. Adjust it based on your indexing strategy.

  Handle failures using the FailureCallback to ensure logs are captured if the connection fails.
  

  ### Running the Application:

  Compile and run the application. Logs will be sent to the specified OpenSearch endpoint, and you 
  should see them in the configured index.
