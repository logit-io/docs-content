## Connect to an OpenSearch Cluster with Python

<Callout type="info">
This sample app was created and tested with `Python 3.11.2` and `pip 24.2` and `requests 2.32.3`
</Callout>

This article assumes that you have already created an OpenSearch Cluster, if you have not yet done this then 
please see this guide to create to create a cluster:

[Creating an OpenSearch Cluster](creating-opensearch-cluster.mdx)

Here's a Python example of sending logs to OpenSearch, this example uses __opensearch-py__ client and 
the __logging library__ for integration.

<Steps>

    ### Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

    Create a virtual environment for the test app.

    ```bash copy
    python -m venv opensearch-env
    ```

    ### Activate the Virtual Environment

    <Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS & Linux"]}>
        <Tab>
            ```bash copy
            opensearch-env\Scripts\activate
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
            ```bash copy
            source opensearch-env/bin/activate
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### Install Dependencies

    * Install the __opensearch-py__ package for interacting with OpenSearch.

    ```bash copy
    pip install requests
    ```

    ### Python Code Example

    Create a new file and call it __send_logs.py__. Open this file using your choice of text editor, paste in the 
    following and then save.

    ```python copy filename="send_logs.py" /@opensearch.endpointAddress/ /@opensearch.username/ /@opensearch.password/
    import requests
    from datetime import datetime
    import json

    # Configuration
    opensearch_url = "@opensearch.endpointAddress:9200"  # OpenSearch endpoint
    index_name = "logit-example"
    username = "@opensearch.username"  # Your username
    password = "@opensearch.password"  # Your password

    # Generate current timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')

    # Log entry
    log_entry = {
        "@timestamp": timestamp,
        "level": "INFO",
        "message": "This is a log message from Python script",
        "service": "example-service"
    }

    # Prepare the request headers
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

    # Define the URL for the specific index
    url = f"{opensearch_url}/{index_name}/_doc/"

    # Send the POST request
    response = requests.post(url, auth=(username, password), headers=headers, data=json.dumps(log_entry))

    # Check response
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("Log entry successfully sent!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send log: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
    ```
    
    ### Key Points

    OpenSearch Client: The opensearch-py client handles the connection, authentication, and indexing.

    The IndexFormat is customizable. Adjust it based on your indexing strategy.

    Logging: The custom OpenSearchHandler sends logs to OpenSearch using the clientâ€™s index method.
    

    ### Running the Application:

    Run the script, and logs should appear in the specified index in OpenSearch.

    Run the script from your command line:

    ```bash copy
    python send_logs.py
    ```

    You should see the output "Log entry successfully sent!"
