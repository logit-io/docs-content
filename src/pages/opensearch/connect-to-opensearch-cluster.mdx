# Connect to an OpenSearch Cluster

This guide will show you how to connect to your OpenSearch cluster after it has been created. You'll learn how to find your connection details and explore different methods to interact with your cluster using various programming languages.

If you have not yet created an OpenSearch Cluster, please see our guide on [Creating an OpenSearch Cluster](creating-opensearch-cluster.mdx) first.

<Steps>
  ### Access Your Cluster Details

  Once your OpenSearch Cluster has been created, you can find your connection details on the Logit.io Dashboard. The Stack summary shows your endpoint, username, and password (hidden by default, but viewable by clicking "show").

  ### Connection Settings

  Here are the settings you'll need to connect to your OpenSearch Cluster:

  Endpoint:
  ```text copy /@opensearch.endpointAddress/ 
  @opensearch.endpointAddress
  ```

  Username:
  ```text copy /@opensearch.username/ 
  @opensearch.username
  ```

  Password:
  ```text copy /@opensearch.password/
  @opensearch.password
