## Connect to an OpenSearch Cluster

This article assumes that you have already created an OpenSearch Cluster, if you have not yet done this then 
please see this guide to create to create a cluster:

[Creating an OpenSearch Cluster](creating-opensearch-cluster.mdx)

<Steps>
  ### Logit.io Dashboard

  Once your OpenSearch Cluster has been created you will be returned to the Logit.io Dashboard. The Stack on 
  this page shows a few basic details. Here you can see the endpoint, username and the password (the password 
  is hidden but clicking show will display it on the screen). These settings are what we need to connect to the 
  OpenSearch Cluster but we will have a look at the settings first.

  To see more of your setting, click the 'settings' link to navigate to the stack settings overview page.

  ### Stack Settings Overview

  The Stack Settings Overview page is where you will find all the information that you need relating to your 
  OpenSearch stack. The first bit of information you should notice is that all of your nodes are in a healthy 
  state and there are no errors.

  Clicking on the 'Endpoints' link in the menu on the left hand side will give you the information that you require 
  to send data to OpenSearch.

  ### Endpoints

  ![OpenSearch Endpoints](@/images/getting-started/opensearch/endpoints.png)

  These are the settings that you require in order to send data to your OpenSearch Cluster, below are examples of 
  how to do this.

  __Note__: Please make sure the ___'opensearch-endpoint'___, ___'your-username'___ and ___'your-password'___ fields 
  are correctly populated.

  If you are logged into your Logit.io account the ___'opensearch-endpoint'___, ___'your-username'___ and ___'your-password'___ 
  fields should have been pre-populated with the correct values.

  ```c# copy /@apikey/ 
  using Serilog;
  using Serilog.Sinks.OpenSearch;
  using System;

  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          // OpenSearch configuration
          var openSearchUri = "https://your-opensearch-endpoint:9200";
          var username = "your-username";
          var password = "your-password";

          // Configure Serilog
          Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
              .Enrich.FromLogContext()
              .WriteTo.Console() // Optional: log to console
              .WriteTo.OpenSearch(new OpenSearchSinkOptions(new Uri(openSearchUri))
              {
                  ModifyConnectionSettings = x => x.BasicAuthentication(username, password),
                  AutoRegisterTemplate = true, // Automatically register index template
                  IndexFormat = "my-app-logs-{0:yyyy.MM.dd}", // Daily index
                  TypeName = null, // For OpenSearch 2.x and above, this should be null
                  EmitEventFailure = EmitEventFailureHandling.WriteToSelfLog | EmitEventFailureHandling.RaiseCallback,
                  FailureCallback = e => Console.WriteLine($"Failed to log to OpenSearch: {e.Message}")
              })
              .CreateLogger();

          try
          {
              // Log some messages
              Log.Information("This is an information log");
              Log.Warning("This is a warning log");
              Log.Error("This is an error log");
          }
          catch (Exception ex)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"Exception occurred: {ex.Message}");
          }
          finally
          {
              // Dispose the logger
              Log.CloseAndFlush();
          }
      }
  }
  ```
