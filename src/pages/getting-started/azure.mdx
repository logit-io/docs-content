# Getting started if you’re running in Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft that provides a wide range of solutions for building, 
deploying, and managing applications and services. It offers compute, storage, databases, networking, artificial intelligence, analytics, 
and more, accessible globally across its extensive network of data centers. Azure is Microsoft’s response to AWS, offering access to 
Microsoft built and managed infrastructure in multiple locations around the globe.

Similar to AWS if you are running virtual servers or a kubernetes cluster on Azure you may wish to send directly from those instances. 
Otherwise integrations with Azure usually involve an Azure EventHub

### Data sent directly

If you are running a kubernetes cluster (AKS)  or virtual machine, generating and sending that data directly is likely the best option.
Here are some guides to help you start sending data to Logit.io.

To get started with data sent directly from Windows click [here](windows).

To get started with data sent directly from Linux click [here](linux).

To get started with data sent directly from Kubernetes click [here](kubernetes).

### Via Azure EventHub

Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion and event streaming service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables the capture, 
retention, and analysis of large volumes of data from various sources, such as applications, sensors, and IoT devices.EventHubs are a message 
queue similar in function to Apache Kafka, data is written to the eventhub within Azure and consumed by Logit into your stack.

__Azure Logs__

Azure Logs is a feature of Microsoft Azure that collects and stores log data from various Azure resources, services, and applications. It 
provides insights into the performance, health, and security of your Azure environment. Logs include activity and diagnostic data, such as 
resource usage, system events, and security audits.

To get started with sending Azure Logs to Logit.io click [here](../integrations/azure/)

__Azure Metrics__

Azure Metrics is a feature within Microsoft Azure that provides real-time, numerical data on the performance and health of Azure resources and 
services. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network traffic, and more. Metrics are 
collected at regular intervals, allowing users to gain insights into resource utilization and detect issues proactively.
