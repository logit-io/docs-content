# Getting started if you’re running in Azure

Azure is Microsoft’s response to AWS, offering access to Microsoft built and managed infrastructure in multiple locations around the globe.

Similar to AWS if you are running virtual servers or a kubernetes cluster on azure you may wish to send directly from those instances. 
Otherwise integrations with Azure usually involve an Azure EventHub

### Data sent directly

If you are running a kubernetes cluster (AKS)  or virtual machine, generating and sending that data directly is likely the best option.
Here are some guides to help you start sending data to Logit.io.

### Via Azure EventHub

EventHubs are a message queue similar in function to Apache Kafka, data is written to the eventhub within Azure and consumed by Logit into 
your stack.
