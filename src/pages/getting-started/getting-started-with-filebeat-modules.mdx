# Getting started with Filebeat Modules

Filebeat modules are pre-built, ready-to-use configurations that simplify the collection, parsing, 
and visualization of logs from specific applications, systems, or services. Each module is tailored 
to handle logs for popular tools and platforms like web servers, databases, cloud services, and more.

## Key Features of Filebeat Modules:

1. Predefined Settings:
   - Modules come with configurations for input paths, processors, and ingest pipelines.

2. Automatic Parsing:
   - Parse logs into structured data (e.g., extracting fields like `method` or `url`).

3. Integrated Dashboards:
   - Many modules provide ready-to-use Kibana / OpenSearch dashboards.

4. Easy Setup:
   - Enable modules with `filebeat modules enable <module_name>`.

5. Customizable:
   - Modules can be fine-tuned for specific environments.

## Examples of Filebeat Modules:
- IIS (Windows IIS logs) - see our [IIS integration](../integrations/iis)
- Nginx (Web server logs) - see our [NGINX integration](../integrations/nginx)
- Apache (Web server logs) - see our [Apache integration](../integrations/apache)
- MySQL (Database logs) - see our [MySQL integration](../integrations/mysql)
- System (OS logs, such as Syslog) - see our [SysLog integration](../integrations/syslog)

Modules streamline workflows and make Filebeat user-friendly for log management tasks.

These modules significantly simplify log management workflows, making Filebeat more user-friendly 
for various use cases.
