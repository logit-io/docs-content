# Getting started with Linux

When getting started with onboarding a Linux installation you will likely want to send one or more of the following:
system logs, applications logs, custom log files, system metrics. We will cover each of these in turn.

## System Logs

System Logs are records of events that have occurred within Linux.
They are usually found in one of two places depending on the flavour of Linux you are using:

`'/var/log/syslog` or accessed via systemd's `journalctl` utility.

We can use what is know as a "log shipper" to collect these logs and send them to Logit.io for analysis. 
Filebeat is a lightweight shipper designed to collect and forward system logs,
including syslog and journal logs, to a centralized platform for analysis.

You can find out more about how to configure Filebeat to send system logs [here](../integrations/filebeat-system).

## Application Logs

Many applications write to their own separate log files and we can use Filebeat to collect these logs 
and send them to Logit.io for analysis. Please see below for instructions to configure Filebeat to send application logs:

You can find out more about how to configure Filebeat to send application logs [here](../integrations/filebeat).

Some applications have their own Filebeat modules, which are preconfigured setups designed 
to simplify the collection, parsing, and visualization of specific types of log files.
For example, the Apache module can be used to collect logs from Apache web servers.

You can find out more about how to configure Filebeat to send Apache logs [here](../integrations/apache).

The Nginx module can be used to collect logs from Nginx web servers:
You can find out more about how to configure Filebeat to send Nginx logs [here](../integrations/nginx).

You can find more information about Filebeat modules [here](../getting-started/getting-started-with-filebeat-modules.mdx).

## Custom Log Files

If you have existing data you wish to send, perhaps logs downloaded from elsewhere, then Filebeat is a good choice, 
it can be configured to watch a file/folder and send files as they arrive, or run once against existing file(s) 
to load the data into logit.

Depending on the format of your logs you may need to do additional filter work to maximise the value of your data, 
but using filebeat is a good starting point.

You can find out more about how to configure Filebeat to send custom logs [here](../integrations/filebeat).

## System Metrics

Metrics provide real-time data that gives administrators a snapshot of how system resources are performing. 
Monitoring metrics related to CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network activity, offer an 
insight into the current health of a system.

The real power of collecting metrics is not just in real-time monitoring but in tracking trends over time. 
By collecting system performance data at regular intervals, allowing administrators to observe how system resources evolve over time.

For example, consistent CPU usage spikes or gradual increases in memory consumption could be early indicators of an 
application issue or resource leak.

Telegraf is a powerful agent that collects system metrics in Linux environments. Telegraf gathers real-time 
data on key system resources and forwards them to a centralized platform for analysis. 

You can find out more about how to configure Telegraf to send system metrics [here](../integrations/system-metrics).
