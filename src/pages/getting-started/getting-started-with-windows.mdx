# Getting started with Windows

When getting started with onboarding a Windows installation you will likely want to send one or more of the following:
system Logs, applications logs, custom log files, system metrics. We will cover each of these in turn.

## System Logs

System logs are records of events that have occurred within Windows. 
The operating system logs these internally to the Windows Event Log 
(which can be viewed using the Windows Event Viewer).

We can use what is know as a "log shipper" to collect these logs and send them to Logit.io for analysis. 
Winlogbeat is a lightweight shipper designed to collect and forward Windows Event Logs, 
including Application, System, and Security logs, to a centralized platform for analysis. 
These logs allow administrators to track critical system activities, errors, and security events, 
such as application crashes, security breaches, or failed login attempts.

You can find instructions for sending logs from Windows [here](../integrations/windows#logs)

## Application Logs

Many applications, even Microsoft ones, do not use the built-in Windows Event Log, 
and instead write to their own separate Log files instead.
While Winlogbeat handles event logs specific to Windows, Filebeat is used for shipping 
other log types (such as application logs, or custom log files) that may be generated 
by applications or services running on the Windows server. 

You can find out more about Filebeat [link to Filebeat getting started guide].

## Custom Log Files

If you have existing data you wish to send, perhaps logs downloaded from elsewhere, 
then Filebeat is a good choice, it can be configured to watch a file/folder and send 
files as they arrive, or run once against existing file(s) to load the data into logit.

Depending on the format of your logs you may need to do additional filter 
work to maximise the value of your data, but using Filebeat is a good starting point.

## Windows System Metrics

Metrics provide real-time data that gives administrators a snapshot of how system resources are performing. 
Monitoring metrics related to CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network activity, 
offer an insight into the current health of a system.

The real power of collecting metrics is not just in real-time monitoring but in tracking trends over time. 
By collecting system performance data at regular intervals, allowing administrators to observe 
how system resources evolve over time.

For example, consistent CPU usage spikes or gradual increases in memory consumption could be early 
indicators of an application issue or resource leak.

Telegraf is a powerful agent that collects system metrics in Windows environments. 
Through its various plugins, such as Windows Performance Counters and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), 
Telegraf gathers real-time data on key system resources and can forward them to Logit.io for analysis.
