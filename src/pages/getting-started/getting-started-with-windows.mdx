# Getting started with Windows

When getting started with onboarding a Windows installation you will likely find one or more of the following guides useful.

Windows System Logs
Applications Logs (running on Windows)
Custom Log files (sending from Windows)
Windows System Metrics


## Windows System Logs

Windows System Logs are records of events that have occurred within a system, Windows logs internally to the Windows Event Log - this can be viewed using the Windows Event Viewer.

Winlogbeat is a lightweight agent designed to collect and forward Windows Event Logs, including Application, System, and Security logs, to a centralized platform for analysis. These logs allow administrators to track critical system activities, errors, and security events, such as application crashes, security breaches, or failed login attempts.

## Application Logs

Many applications, even Microsoft ones, do not use the built in Windows Event Log, and instead write to their own separate Log files instead.
Filebeat, like Winlogbeat, is another lightweight log shipper, but it focuses on forwarding log files (such as application logs, or custom log files) to centralized systems for analysis. While Winlogbeat handles event logs specific to Windows, Filebeat is used for shipping other log types that may be generated by applications or services running on the Windows server. 
If there is a more specifically matching document please follow that, but otherwise the Filebeat installation instructions are a good starting point.

## Custom Log Files

If you have existing data you wish to send, perhaps logs downloaded from elsewhere, then Filebeat is a good choice, it can be configured to watch a file/folder and send files as they arrive, or run once against existing file(s) to load the data into logit.

Depending on the format of your logs you may need to do additional filter work to maximise the value of your data, but using filebeat is a good starting point.

## Windows System Metrics

Metrics provide real-time data that gives administrators a snapshot of how system resources are performing. Monitoring metrics related to CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network activity, offer an insight into the current health of a system.

The real power of collecting metrics is not just in real-time monitoring but in tracking trends over time. By collecting system performance data at regular intervals, allowing administrators to observe how system resources evolve over time.

For example, consistent CPU usage spikes or gradual increases in memory consumption could be early indicators of an application issue or resource leak.

Telegraf is a powerful agent that collects system metrics in Windows environments. Through its various plugins, such as Windows Performance Counters and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), Telegraf gathers real-time data on key system resources and forwards them to a centralized platform for analysis.
