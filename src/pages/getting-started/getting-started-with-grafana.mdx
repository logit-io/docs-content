# Getting started with Grafana

In this guide we are going to explain what Grafana is and how to view your data in Grafana. We will go through a 
step-by-step example of viewing an individual metric in Grafana.


## What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization tool that allows you to monitor, query, and visualize data from a wide range of sources in real time. 
It's especially popular in system monitoring, observability, and DevOps because it enables users to create highly customizable, interactive dashboards 
that consolidate complex metrics into clear, actionable insights. By supporting multiple data sources like VictoriaMetrics, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, 
and many more, Grafana serves as a central hub for monitoring infrastructure and applications. Its flexibility, combined with features like 
alerting and annotation, makes it invaluable for identifying trends, diagnosing issues, and optimizing performance in a visually intuitive way. 

Whether you're tracking system health or analyzing user behavior, Grafana is a powerful tool to turn raw data into meaningful visuals.

## Viewing your data in Grafana

Now we're going to show you how to view your data in Grafana with a very simple example.
These are the steps we will follow:
- Install Telegraf and configure it to send metrics to Logit.io.
- Send a simple metric to Logit.io.
- View the metric in Grafana.

### Install Telegraf

If you don't already have it installed, please follow the instructions [here](../integrations/telegraf.mdx) to install Telegraf. 
Once installed, return here to continue.

### Configure Telegraf

The default `telegraf.conf` configuration file is thousands of lines long so, for simplicity, we will create a new
  configuration file for this guide.
  Create a new text file and copy the configuration details below into it and save it as `telegraf-demo.conf` in 
  the directory where Telegraf has been installed.

The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts.

  <Tab>
    We are going to use the `win_perf_counters` input plugin to scrape the CPU usage metric from your Windows host.
  
    ```toml copy
    [[inputs.win_perf_counters]]
      [[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]
        ObjectName = "Processor"
        Instances = ["_Total"]
        Counters = [
          "% Processor Time",
        ]
        Measurement = "win_cpu"
        IncludeTotal = true
    
        [[outputs.http]]
        url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
        data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"
    
        [outputs.http.headers]
          Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
          Content-Encoding = "snappy"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    We are going to use the `inputs.cpu` input plugin to scrape the CPU usage metric from your host.
  
    ```toml copy
    [[inputs.cpu]]
    ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
    percpu = false
    ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
    totalcpu = true
    ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics
    collect_cpu_time = false
    ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states
    ## NOTE: The resulting 'time_active' field INCLUDES 'iowait'!
    report_active = false
    ## If true and the info is available then add core_id and physical_id tags
    core_tags = false
    ```
  </Tab>

### Start Telegraf

<Tabs items={["Windows (Powershell)", "Ubuntu & Debian", "macOS", "Red Hat & centOS", "Linux binaries (64-bit)"]} unlink>
  <Tab>
    From the location where Telegraf was installed (`C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf-1.34.1`) run the program 
    providing the chosen configuration file as a parameter:
  
    ```ps1 copy
    .\telegraf.exe --config telegraf-demo.conf
    ```

    Once Telegraf is running you should see output similar to the following, which confirms the inputs, 
    output and basic configuration the application has been started with:

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    sudo telegraf --config telegraf-demo.conf
    ```

    For systemd installations

    ```bash copy
    sudo /usr/bin/telegraf --config /path/to/telegraf-demo.conf
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    telegraf --config telegraf-demo.conf
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    telegraf --config telegraf-demo.conf
    ```

    For systemd installations

    ```bash copy
    sudo /usr/bin/telegraf --config /path/to/telegraf-demo.conf
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    telegraf --config telegraf-demo.conf
    ```

    For systemd installations

    ```bash copy
    sudo /usr/bin/telegraf --config /path/to/telegraf-demo.conf
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### View your metrics in Grafana

Once you have started Telegraf, the CPU metric data we set-up in the configuration file will be sent to your Logit.io stack and can be viewed in Grafana. 

Click the 'Launch Metrics' button below to open Grafana.

<LaunchVisualizer type="metrics" />

In the Grafana interface, you will see a side menu on the left-hand side.
This menu provides access to various features and functionalities of Grafana, including dashboards, alerts, and data sources. 
Click on the "Explore" option in the side menu to access the Explore page, where you can query and visualize your data interactively.

On the Explore page there is a Metric drop-down more or less in the middle of the page.
This drop-down allows you to select the metric we have have just configured to be sent to your stack.

On Windows, the metric name is `win_cpu_Percent_Processor_Time` and on other Operating Systems it is `cpu_XXX`.

To the right of the Metric drop-down is a `Label filters` field. 
Choose `host` from the drop-down and select the name of your host (i.e. computer) in the `Select value` field to the right. 
(There should only be one option in the `Select value` field if you have only one host sending metrics to your stack.)

![Grafana Explore page focus](@/images/getting-started/grafana-explore2.png)

Click on the blue `Run Query` button (with the circular double arrows) 
to the top right of the page to run the query and view the results, 
which will be displayed in a graph at the bottom of the page. 
This data is being pulled from your Logit.io stack 
and (as we'd expect) is the total CPU usage of the machine the Telegraf agent is running on.

To the immediate right of the `Run Query` button is an `Auto-refresh` drop-down. 
If you select a time period from this drop-down,
this will automatically refresh the data in the graph at the bottom at the chosen interval.
If you choose `5s` for example, the data will refresh every 5 seconds. 
If you run a processor-intensive task on your computer you should see the graph reporting higher values while that task is active.

When you have finished exploring the data, you can stop Telegraf by pressing `Ctrl + C` (`Cmd + C` on Mac) in the terminal window where it is running.

## Grafana Dashboards

You can find out more about Grafana Dashboards, include how to create them [here](../getting-started/getting-started-with-grafana#dashboards).

Dashboards in Grafana are dynamic, interactive visual interfaces that provide a consolidated view of data from various sources. 
They are highly customizable, allowing users to arrange panels to display metrics in formats such as graphs, gauges, heatmaps, and tables. 
Dashboards are essential for monitoring system health, tracking performance trends, and identifying anomalies across infrastructure or applications. 
With features like real-time updates, templating, and filters, they empower users to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. 
Whether you're a developer troubleshooting an issue or an operations team optimizing resources, dashboards serve as a single-pane-of-glass 
view that simplifies complex data into actionable insights. Let me know if you'd like to dive into specific dashboard features!
