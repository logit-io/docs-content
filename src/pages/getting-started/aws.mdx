# Getting started if you’re running in AWS

Amazon Web Services started out as a way to sell access to the platform Amazon had built to support its ecommerce operations and 
now accounts a significant fraction of amazons profits.

Amazon offer various built in tools to access and view your logs and metrics, if you want to go beyond what they can offer you will 
usually need to send your data via one of three methods, unless you are running EKS or ECS instances when viewing the kubernetes, 
linux or windows tutorials and collecting your data directly may be more appropriate. There is a fourth option where data can be 
polled periodically from the cloudwatch API, this should be used sparingly as it generates lots of data, but rarely is most of it 
helpful.

### Data sent directly

If you are running an EKS cluster or ECS, generating and sending that data directly is likely the best option.

To get started with data sent directly from Kubernetes click [here](kubernetes).

### Via an S3 bucket

S3 (simple storage service) was one of AWS’s earliest products and has become a common option for exporting data from other Amazon Services. 
Log files get saved into an S3 bucket and then consumed from there into a Logit stack.CloudFront uses a network of globally distributed edge 
locations to cache content closer to end users, improving performance and reducing load on origin servers. To learn more about using an S3 
bucket to send logs and metrics to Logit.io click [here](../integrations/s3/).

Here are some examples of Amazon Services that can send data to Logit.io using an S3 bucket:

__CloudFront__

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by AWS. It securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to 
users with low latency and high transfer speeds.

To find out more about how to log from CloudFront using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/cloudfront/).

__CloudTrail__

Amazon CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing for your AWS account. It records and logs 
detailed information about API calls and actions taken in your AWS environment, including who performed the action, when it occurred, and the 
resources involved.

To find out more on how to log from CloudTrail using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/cloudtrail/).

__ELB Application (ELB)__

Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a service that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, 
such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, containers, or IP addresses. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model), enabling advanced routing based 
on request attributes like URLs, headers, and query strings.

To find out more on how to log from ELB using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/elb-application/).

__Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Classic__

Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Classic Load Balancer is a legacy load balancing service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple Amazon 
EC2 instances. Operating at both the transport layer (Layer 4) and application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, it supports basic routing and 
load-balancing features, such as SSL termination and sticky sessions.

To find out more on how to log from ELB Classic using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/elb-classic/).

__Relational Database Service (RDS)__

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service provided by AWS that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational 
databases in the cloud. It supports multiple database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora. RDS automates 
routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backups, and scaling, freeing users to focus on application development.

To find out more on how to log from RDS using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/rds/).

__Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)__

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that allows users to create isolated, customizable networks within the AWS cloud. With VPC, you can define 
your network's IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, gateways, and security settings to control traffic. It enables secure 
communication between AWS resources and on-premises networks via VPNs or Direct Connect.

To find out more on how to log from VPC using an S3 bucket click [here](../integrations/vpc/).

### Via a Lambda function

AWS CloudWatch Lambda integration enables monitoring and observability for AWS Lambda functions. It collects performance metrics such as invocation count, 
duration, and error rates, as well as custom logs generated by Lambda functions. Lambda functions are part of AWS’s serverless platform, where all the 
hosting is handled by aws and the customer simply provides the code they want to run.

These could generate and send logs/metrics directly to Logit, or be called by a third service acting as a forwarder for messages, potentially 
preprocessing messages or adding additional information to messages.

To learn more about sending data to Logit.io via a Lambda function click [here](../integrations/aws-cloudwatch-lambda/).

### Via an SQS queue

SQS (Services Simple Queue Service) is a message queue, messages are generated within AWS and consumed by Logit to transfer data to your stack.

It is better suited to those situations where there are lower volumes of data with low latency requirements. Data sent via an S3 bucket often is 
batched and compressed, which increases the latency between message generation and its availability in a Logit stack, but this also can result in 
reduced costs.

To learn more about sending data to Logit.io using SQS click [here](../log-management/ingestion-pipeline/adding-inputs/add-sqs-input).

### From cloudwatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service from AWS that provides insights into your cloud resources and applications. It collects and 
tracks metrics, logs, and events from AWS services and custom sources, enabling you to visualize performance, identify issues, and set up automated 
responses.

The cloudwatch API exposes lots of metrics from within AWS, it should be used sparingly to monitor specific functions and metrics. Attempting to consume 
everything rarely provides meaningful insight, whereas monitoring and alerting on specific metrics can help identify issues before they interfere with normal 
performance.
