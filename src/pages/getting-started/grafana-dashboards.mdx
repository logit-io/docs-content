# Getting started with Grafana Dashboards

Grafana dashboards are powerful, customizable visual interfaces designed to help users monitor, analyze, and interpret data from various sources. As part of the 
open-source Grafana platform, these dashboards allow organizations to consolidate metrics and logs into a unified view, providing real-time insights and historical 
trends.

### What Is Grafana Dashboards?

At their core, Grafana dashboards are composed of panels, each representing a specific type of visualization such as graphs, tables, heatmaps, or gauges. Users can 
tailor these panels to display key performance indicators (KPIs), system health, or application metrics, drawing data from diverse sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, 
InfluxDB, or cloud platforms.

### Why Use Grafana Dashboards?

What sets Grafana dashboards apart is their flexibility and user-centric design. They empower teams to create dynamic and interactive views, enabling deeper exploration of 
data through filters, drilldowns, and alerts. Whether you’re troubleshooting infrastructure issues, monitoring application performance, or visualizing business metrics, 
Grafana dashboards serve as a cornerstone for data-driven decision-making.

### Using Grafana Dashboards with Logit.io

To use Grafana Dashboards with Logit.io you need to create an Infrastructure Metrics stack or Log Management stack and send some data. Logit.io provides Grafana Dashboards as 
part of the Metrics Infrastructure stack and can be added as an extra to the Log Management stack for visualizing your metrics and logs.

To learn more about how to create an Infrastructure Metrics stack click [here](../infrastructure-metrics/)

To learn more about how to send metric data to your stack click [here](../infrastructure-metrics/getting-started/)

To learn more about how to create a Log Management stack click [here](../log-management/)

To learn more about how to send log data to your stack click [here](../log-management/getting-started/)

Once you have created your stack and sent data, you can launch the Grafana Dashboards visualizer to view your stack's data. If you have an Infrastructure Metrics stack, you do 
this by pressing the `Launch Metrics` button found at the top of your Logit.io stack or on the stack settings page:

If you have a Log Management stack, you do this by clicking on the `Launch Grafana` button of your stack on the dashboard.

Logit.io provides custom dashboards that are ready for you to use. You can also create your own dashboards.

### How to create a Grafana Dashboard

Dashboards are collections of visualizations (panels). Click [here](../infrastructure-metrics/visualizers/) to read more about them and how they are created.

Panels are the building blocks of a dashboard:

__Choose Visualization Type__ - Select from graphs, tables, gauges, heatmaps, and more.

__Configure Data Query__ - Define how data should be fetched from your data source.

Use Grafana’s query builder for basic queries.

Use the query editor for advanced configurations.

__Customize Panel Settings__ - Adjust titles, labels, thresholds, and colors for better readability.

### Working with your Grafana Dashboard

After you have saved your new visualization you can then organise and customize, here are examples of some of the things you may want to do:

__Resize and Rearrange Panels__ - Drag and drop panels to arrange them as needed.

__Add Variables: Create variables (such as time ranges or filters) to make your dashboard dynamic and interactive.

__Set Themes__ - Use the dashboard settings to switch between light and dark themes.

__Set Up Alerts__

Alerts notify you of critical conditions in your data. Grafana’s alerts, integrated with notification channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty, enable real-time incident response, 
ensuring operational continuity and minimizing downtime.

Setting up alerts in Grafana dashboards is crucial for proactive monitoring and immediate response to critical conditions. Here are some examples of where alerts are highly 
beneficial:

__Monitoring System Performance__ - Alert when CPU or memory usage exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential resource exhaustion, or trigger alerts if available disk space drops 
below a critical level to prevent data loss or system failure.

__Application Health__ - Alert when the error rate in an application increases, signaling potential bugs or degraded performance. Notify when API or service response times exceed 
acceptable levels, impacting user experience. Detect and alert if an application or service becomes unavailable.

__Infrastructure Stability__ - Monitor server availability and send alerts for unexpected reboots or crashes. Trigger alerts if network latency surpasses a predefined limit, indicating 
connectivity issues. Notify when query times exceed expectations, or when database locks persist.

__Security__ - Alert on a surge in failed login attempts, signaling a potential brute-force attack or notify when specific endpoints or sensitive data are accessed unexpectedly.

__Business Metrics__ - Trigger alerts when sales or revenue decline significantly below expected levels or notify when user activity metrics (e.g., sign-ups or page views) deviate sharply 
from norms.

__Log Analysis__ - Alert on specific error messages or patterns appearing in logs or notify when unusual log patterns or spikes occur, indicating abnormal system behavior.
To create alerts, open a panel and click Edit. Navigate to the Alert tab and then configure alert conditions, evaluation frequency, and notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

### Summary

Grafana dashboards are customizable visual interfaces that consolidate and display metrics and logs from various data sources. They are composed of panels, each visualizing 
data as graphs, tables, gauges, or other formats. Designed for real-time monitoring and analysis, Grafana dashboards are highly interactive, allowing users to filter, explore, and 
customize data views. They also support alerts, enabling proactive responses to critical conditions. With their flexibility and integrative capabilities, Grafana dashboards empower 
teams to make data-driven decisions effectively. To find out more about using Grafana Dashboards with Logit.io, you can click [here](../infrastructure-metrics/visualizers/)
