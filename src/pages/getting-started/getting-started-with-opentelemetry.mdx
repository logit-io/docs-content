# Getting started with OpenTelemetry

​OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to collect, process, and export telemetry data from software applications 
and system processes. By standardizing how telemetry data is captured and transmitted, OpenTelemetry enables developers to monitor application 
performance, diagnose issues, and optimize systems with ease. Its vendor-neutral approach ensures compatibility with various observability 
tools and platforms, making it a versatile choice for achieving deep insights into distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

Integrating with Logit.io enables comprehensive observability by collecting, processing, aOpenTelemetry nd visualizing telemetry data such as 
traces, metrics, and logs. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to set up OpenTelemetry within your application and configure it to send 
data to Logit.io.

### OpenTelemetry for Traces

Using OpenTelemetry for traces enables detailed tracking of requests as they flow through your application, distributed system, or system processes. 
Traces provide a visual representation of how operations are executed across services, making it easier to diagnose issues and optimize performance.

Use OpenTelemetry to capture spans, which represent individual operations within a trace.

Enrich spans with metadata, such as timestamps, errors, and custom attributes, for deeper insights.

Use Logit.io to send trace data to Jaeger for visualization and analysis.

By correlating traces with logs and metrics, OpenTelemetry offers a unified observability approach, helping teams identify bottlenecks, optimize 
workflows, and maintain reliable systems.

### OpenTelemetry for Logs

Using OpenTelemetry for logs involves capturing, processing, and exporting log data from your application and system processes in a standardized way.

OpenTelemetry enables generation of logs that include rich contextual information, such as trace and span IDs for enhanced traceability. The Logs 
can be sent to Logit.io for analysis and visualization.

OpenTelemetry enables seamless integration with other telemetry data (traces and metrics), making it easier to diagnose issues, detect anomalies, 
and optimize system performance.

This approach helps developers and operators streamline observability workflows and gain actionable insights into their applications' behavior.

### OpenTelemetry for Metrics

Using OpenTelemetry for metrics involves collecting, processing, and exporting quantitative data that reflects the performance and behavior of your 
application or system. Metrics, such as request counts, error rates, and response times, provide real-time insights into system health and resource 
utilization.


Use OpenTelemetry to define and record custom metrics, or rely on auto-instrumentation for common libraries, frameworks and system processes.

Capture system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network activity to monitor infrastructure performance.

Use Logit.io to send metrics to a preferred backend, such as Prometheus or Grafana for visualization and monitoring.

Combine metrics with traces and logs for a comprehensive view of system behavior, enabling root cause analysis and performance optimization.

By standardizing metric collection, OpenTelemetry simplifies observability and helps maintain robust, performant systems.
