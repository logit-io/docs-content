# Getting started with OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards is an open-source, data visualization and exploration tool designed to work with OpenSearch. It provides powerful real-time dashboards, charts, 
and analytics for your log data. Whether you're monitoring infrastructure, debugging applications, or tracking business metrics, OpenSearch Dashboards makes it easy 
to turn raw data into actionable insights.

### What Is OpenSearch Dashboards?

OpenSearch Dashboards is the user interface for OpenSearch — the open-source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It allows you to visualize and interact with your data 
stored in OpenSearch through:

Interactive dashboards and visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, tables, maps)

Full-text search and filtering

Real-time log monitoring

Alerting, anomaly detection, and observability features

### Why Use OpenSearch Dashboards?

OpenSearch Dashboards is ideal for companies, teams or users that want to:

**Centralize observability data:** Logsfrom multiple sources  can be stored in OpenSearch and visualized in one place.

**Monitor system health:** Build dashboards that track infrastructure performance (CPU, memory, disk usage), application behavior, or uptime.

**Troubleshoot faster:** Filter and search through logs to quickly identify issues or anomalies.

**Create shareable reports:** Build and export custom dashboards for stakeholders or audit purposes.

**Visualize business intelligence:** Track KPIs and user behavior across applications.

**Key Features**

Real-time data exploration and dashboards

Powerful search and filtering using OpenSearch Query DSL or Lucene

Multiple visualization types including charts, maps, and gauges

Alerting and notifications via OpenSearch plugins

Role-based access control (when integrated with OpenSearch security features)

Integration with Beats, Logstash, Fluentd, and many other data shippers

### Using Opensearch Dashboards with Logit.io

To use Opensearch Dashboards with Logit.io you need to create a Log Management or Hosted Opensearch stack and send some data. Logit.io provides the OpenSearch Dashboards 
as part of the Log Management stack and can be added as an extra to the Hosted Opensearch stack for visualizing your distributed traces.

To learn more about how to create a Log Management stack click [here](../log-management/)

To learn more about how to create a Hosted OpenSearch stack click [here](../opensearch/)

Once you have created your stack and sent data you can launch the OpenSearch Dashboards visualizer to view your stack's data by pressing the `Launch Logs` button found at 
the top of your Logit.io stack settings page:

This part of the article will explain some of the key features to help you get started with OpenSearch Dashboards.When the Opensearch Dashboard visualizer opens you will 
see the `Discovery` view.

**Discovery**

Use Discover to explore raw logs and search through data.

You can use the `Search` bar at the top of the page to search for a word or expression.

You can choose a field to narrow a search by selecting a particular field.

![Select Field](@/images/help/log-management/getting-started/select-fields.png)

Selecting a field (e.g., `status_code`, `host`, `user_id`) allows you to:

Apply filters based on values (e.g., only show logs where status_code is 500)

Narrow down large datasets to investigate issues or trends

Drill down into specific subsets of your data

See the frequency of field values

Look for spikes in error.message

Filter on specific service.name or trace.id values

Isolate logs from a particular host, container, or time period

You can also change the date range

![Date Range](@/images/help/log-management/getting-started/opensearch-date-range.png)

Using the date range in OpenSearch Dashboards is essential for focusing your analysis on the most relevant time period. Here's why it's important:

You can narrow down to:

**Last 15 minutes** to troubleshoot an ongoing incident

**Yesterday** to review recent deployments or events

**Custom range** to investigate a historical outage or trend

This helps reduce noise and lets you focus on data that matters. You can set the date range to align with known events such as error logs around a failed deployment, 
traffic surges during a product launch and outages or performance drops.

Using the date range properly ensures you're looking at the right data, at the right time, and it’s one of the most powerful tools in OpenSearch Dashboards for 
actionable analysis.

**Dashboards**

From the Discovery page you can click the three lines menu button in the top left of the page to open the side menu and click `Dashboards`.

Dashboards are customizable, interactive visual displays that let you monitor, explore, and analyze your data in real time—all in one place.

A dashboard is a collection of visualizations—like charts, graphs, tables, maps, and more—that represent different slices of your log data. Think of it as a command 
center for understanding what’s happening in your application, infrastructure, or business. Logit.io installs a number of dashboards for you when we create your Log 
Management stack.

![Date Range](@/images/help/log-management/getting-started/opensearch-dashboards.png)

Dashboards help you spot trends, patterns, and anomalies at a glance without running multiple queries manually.

You can pull data from logs into one cohesive view and track things like error spikes, latency issues, service performance and application health.

Dashboards can be shared with stakeholders or teams for collaboration, reporting, or incident reviews.

**Alerting**

Alerting in OpenSearch Dashboards allows you to monitor your data continuously and get notified when specific conditions are met—such as error spikes, slow response 
times, or system failures.

Using the Alerting plugin, you can define monitors that run queries on your data and trigger alerts when thresholds are breached. These alerts can be sent via email, 
Slack, webhooks, or other integrations.

Alerting helps teams react quickly to issues, maintain system uptime, and enforce SLAs—making it an essential part of observability with OpenSearch.
