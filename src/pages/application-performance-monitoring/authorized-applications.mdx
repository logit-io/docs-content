# How do you ensure that only authorized applications can send traces/spans to OpenSearch

Securing traces and spans sent to OpenSearch is crucial for maintaining the 
integrity of your distributed tracing data. This guide highlights the use 
of username and password credentials over secure protocols like HTTPS and 
gRPC to ensure that only authorized applications can send data. Discover 
how the platform/UI simplifies this process, providing effortless 
authentication for your OpenSearch cluster.

## Authorizing Applications with User Credentials

Your Logit.io stacks are configured for HTTPS and gRPC using username 
and password, to view your Jaeger Open Telemetry endpoint details for 
a stack, navigate to `Open Telemetry Inputs` settings.

## User Authentication Over HTTPS:

- **Automatic SSL/TLS Certificates:**
	- The platform/UI streamlines SSL/TLS certificate management for secure HTTPS communication.
- **OpenSearch Configuration:**
	- User authentication is seamlessly handled, allowing secure access using usernames and passwords.
- **Application Integration:**
	- Easily integrate your application or tracing agent with the automatically configured HTTPS endpoint, utilizing user credentials for authentication.

## User Authentication Over gRPC:

- **Automatic gRPC Support:**
	- The platform/UI enables gRPC support on your OpenSearch instance.
- **Secure OpenSearch Configuration:**
	- User credentials for gRPC authentication are effortlessly managed by the platform/UI.
- **Application Configuration:**
	- Update your application configuration to utilize the automatically configured gRPC endpoint, securing communication with user credentials.

## Conclusion:

By prioritizing the use of username and password credentials over secure 
protocols like HTTPS and gRPC, the platform/UI simplifies the authentication 
process. This ensures that only authorized applications can seamlessly send 
traces and spans to your OpenSearch cluster, simplifying the configuration 
of encryption and secure communication while bolstering the overall 
security of your distributed tracing data.
