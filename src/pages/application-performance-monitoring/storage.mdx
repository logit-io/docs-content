### What is APM Storage?

Application Performance Monitoring (APM) storage, in the context of APM solutions, 
refers to the data storage infrastructure and mechanisms used to store the 
performance data and metrics collected from applications and IT systems. 
APM tools continuously monitor applications and infrastructure components to 
gather data on performance metrics, errors, logs, and other relevant information. 
This data is then stored for analysis, troubleshooting, and reporting purposes.

### Working with APM Storage

From your dashboard, scroll down to find the application performance 
monitoring (APM) section. You will then find the 'Storage' card between 
'Ingestion pipeline' and 'Visualizers where you can find further 
details about your APM Storage nodes.'

containers comprising your OpenSearch cluster. Also, you can view individual 
instances, including their health, size and cores.
