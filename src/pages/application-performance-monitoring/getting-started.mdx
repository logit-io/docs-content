# Get Started Sending Traces

Embarking on the path of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and tracing your 
application's behaviour is a critical aspect of maintaining a high-performance system. 
Through the seamless integration of Jaeger, Logit.io, and OpenTelemetry, Logit.io 
demystifies the complexities of APM and tracing, empowering you to glean invaluable 
insights into your application's performance.

Join us on this journey to simplify APM monitoring and make informed, data-driven 
decisions. This guide illustrates that with Logit.io, the process 
is more straightforward than you might think.

### Where to Begin...
In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of utilizing OpenTelemetry to 
transmit APM traces to Jaeger via Logit.io. You'll become proficient at 
customizing data transmission, comprehend how APM traces are stored, and use 
Jaeger to explore and interpret your application's invaluable performance data.

  While Jaeger is a potent tool for APM, it might not cover all scenarios. Logit.io offers 
  various shippers in our Data Source Integrations. If Jaeger doesn't precisely align 
  with your needs, explore other options for a tailored solution.

### Why Use OpenTelemetry with Jaeger?
OpenTelemetry, a powerful observability framework, serves as the ideal conduit for 
capturing and transmitting application performance metrics to Jaeger. The synergy 
of OpenTelemetry with Jaeger and Logit.io centralizes your APM, providing a unified 
platform to gain deeper insights into your application's behaviour and performance.

### Configuring OpenTelemetry for APM Traces
Once your initial Logit.io stack is set up, navigate to your dashboard and 
initiate the configuration process by clicking on _View Data Integrations_.

We are going to use the OpenTelemetry .NET Core (HTTPS) in our example so 
navigate to `Integrations > Application Performance Monitoring > Language & Libraries` 
and then select _OpenTelemetry .NET Core (HTTPS)_

  If you prefer an alternative data source, feel free to make your 
  selection at this stage. Choosing a different data source prompts the 
  display of source wizard instructions tailored to your chosen data source.

Now, let's proceed to configure OpenTelemetry for seamless APM trace transmission 
to Jaeger. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth integration for 
comprehensive application performance monitoring.

### Install and Configure

In Step 1, kick off the process by creating a new 'ASP.NET Core Empty' application. 
To seamlessly integrate OpenTelemetry packages into your project, employ either 
the NuGet Package Manager or the command line. It's crucial to verify the package 
versions for potential updates since the .NET Core/5+ OpenTelemetry APIs are 
continuously evolving. Copy the entire contents from step 1 as 
shown below using the Copy button.

```xml copy
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console" Version="1.6.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol" Version="1.6.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting" Version="1.6.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore" Version="1.5.1-beta.1" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http" Version="1.5.1-beta.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Moving on to Step 2, incorporate OpenTelemetry settings into your `appsettings.json` 
file. Configure essential parameters such as the service name, OTLP endpoint URL, 
communication protocol, and port, as demonstrated. Copy the entire contents 
from step 2 as shown below and add this to your appsettings.json file.

```json copy
"OpenTelemetry": {
  "ServiceName": "Open Telemetry Tracing - Test App",
  "OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://<your-opentelemetry-endpoint-address>",
  "Protocol": "<your-opentelemetry-protocol>",
  "Port": "<your-opentelemetry-endpoint-port>"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  In this step, the output code snippet is conveniently pre-configured with 
  your Logit.io stack ID's OTLP endpoint URL. It should be similar to the 
  example provided above. If, for any reason, it's not pre-configured, you 
  can locate your specific OTLP endpoint URL by navigating 
  to `Dashboard > APM/Tracing > Manage Stack > Open Telemetry Inputs`.
</Callout>

### Integrate the code
Now, in Step 3, integrate OpenTelemetry into your Program.cs file using 
the provided code snippet. This code is adapted from the Microsoft 
article and offers additional insights on using OpenTelemetry with .NET.

### Confirm data is in Jaeger
After following the instructions, it's time to validate that your APM traces 
are accessible in Jaeger. To achieve this, navigate to Step 5 of the 
integration guide and select "Launch Dashboard." 
Alternatively, from your main dashboard, choose "Launch Metrics."

![Launch Buttons](@/images/help/apm/launch-buttons.png)

Once Jaeger is launched, you should be able to visualize the APM traces that 
have been ingested via the ingestion pipeline. Take advantage of Jaeger's 
capabilities to filter data by time, fields, and content, allowing for a 
thorough exploration of your application's performance metrics. 
This exploration is key to gaining comprehensive insights into your APM landscape.

![Jaeger Traces](@/images/help/apm/overview/jaeger-ui.png)

In case no data appears in your Logit.io stack, outlined in Step 5, refer to 
the Help Centre guide or promptly contact our support team for assistance. 
Diagnostic steps will be provided to identify and resolve potential issues.

Lastly, gain insights into the .NET Core platform's open-source nature and 
its versatility for cross-platform development, as discussed in Step 6. 
Acknowledge the challenges associated with tracing and logging in .NET Core, 
and highlight the streamlined log visualization offered by Logit.io's 
hosted OpenSearch. Additionally, offer assistance for those looking to 
migrate their .NET Core traces to OpenSearch through the 
Help Centre or live chat support.

### Troubleshooting?
Encountering issues with APM/Tracing data visibility in Jaeger? Here are 
some troubleshooting steps to help you identify and resolve potential issues:

**Configuration Validation:**

- **Syntax Errors:** Thoroughly review your OpenTelemetry configuration settings for syntax errors or typos. Even a minor mistake can hinder the collection and transmission of tracing data.

**Jaeger Configuration:**

- **Jaeger Endpoint Settings:** Double-check the configuration of your Jaeger output settings. Ensure that the OTLP endpoint URL is accurately specified, matching the one provided in your Logit.io dashboard.

**Network and Firewall Considerations:**

- **Firewall Rules:** Verify that your firewall settings permit outbound connections from the host running your OpenTelemetry application. Inspect for any firewall restrictions that might obstruct the transmission of tracing data.

**OTLP Endpoint URL:**

- **Endpoint URL Validity:** Confirm that the specified OTLP endpoint URL in your OpenTelemetry configuration aligns with the details provided in your Logit.io dashboard. A mismatch can hinder the successful delivery of tracing data.

These troubleshooting steps should assist in identifying and addressing any issues preventing the proper visualization of APM/Tracing data in Jaeger.
