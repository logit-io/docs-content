# Application Performance Monitoring Statistics

## What are Usage Statistics?

Application Performance Metrics usage statistics pertaining to the data and 
insights gathered regarding the performance and utilization of various components 
within an IT infrastructure, specifically focusing on the data sent to your APM stack.

Understanding how ingestion is calculated, managing active spans/traces, and 
being aware of the associated costs are crucial for effectively utilizing your 
APM (Application Performance Monitoring) platform. By staying informed about 
these metrics, you can optimize your usage, control expenses, and gain valuable 
insights into your application's performance.

### Working with Metrics Statistics

To access your Application Performance Metrics Usage Statistics, navigate to the 
initial dashboard and scroll down to the Application Performance Metrics section. 
In the top right corner, you will find a `Statistics` button. 
Clicking on this button will direct you to the Usage Statistics page. 
Additionally, you can access usage statistics from the left-hand menu. 
Under the heading `Application Performance Monitoring`, you will find the  `Statistics` 
settings, leading you to the same `Usage Statistics` page.

On the "Usage Statistics" page, you can view APM data usage statistics, including:

**Today:** See your APM data usage for Today, including Spans for today, Spans 
this month and an overview of your percentage used based on your selected plan.

**Breakdown by Days:** See how your APM count data usage has evolved over the past few days.

**Historic Usage:** Get insights into your APM data usage for up to a year's worth of records.

Scroll down to find a detailed daily breakdown of Metrics usage. This section 
provides the following information:

**Monthly Count:** The Monthly Count represents the total number of 
spans or metrics sent during a calendar month. It provides a 
comprehensive view of your APM usage on a monthly basis, allowing 
you to track trends and patterns in your application's performance.

**Plan Monthly Send:** Plan Monthly Send refers to the predefined limit 
set in your subscription plan for the number of spans you can send per month. 
Understanding this limit is crucial for efficient resource management and cost control.

**Plan Max Send:** A percentage representing your current 
Metrics data usage in comparison to your plan limits.

**Plan Limits:** It's important to note that your APM usage should align with 
your plan limits to avoid any overage charges or service interruptions.
