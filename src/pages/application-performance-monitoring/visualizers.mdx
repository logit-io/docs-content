# What are APM Visualizations?

APM (Application Performance Monitoring) visualizations are graphical 
representations of performance-related data and metrics collected from 
applications and their associated infrastructure. These visualizations 
are essential for quickly identifying performance issues, troubleshooting 
problems, and making data-driven decisions to optimize application performance.

## Working with APM Visualizers

To locate your Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Visualizers, from 
the initial dashboard, scroll to the bottom to find the Application Performance 
Monitoring section, here you'll see a card for 'Visualizers'. Additionally, 
you can select 'Launch' next to 'Jaeger' under 'Services' that will take you 
to Jaeger UI where you can further analyze your data.

## APM: Visualizers

With the Visualizers card you can utilize dashboards to gain insights from, 
investigate, and analyze your APM data, enabling well-informed decision-making.

## Jaeger Nodes

In the context of Jaeger, an open-source distributed tracing system used 
for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based applications, nodes 
refer to components or instances within the Jaeger architecture that perform 
specific roles in collecting, processing, and visualizing trace data. Here, 
you can view the individual instances, its health and size. 

## Viewing Jaeger

Once you have selected “launch APM” at the top of the overview page you 
will be able to view all of your trace data within the Jaeger UI:

From here you can select “search” to search your ingested trace data in more detail.
