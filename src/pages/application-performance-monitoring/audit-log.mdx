# Application Performance Monitoring: Audit Log Overview

## What are Audit Logs?

Audit Logs in the context of APM refer to records or logs that capture 
and document actions or events related to the management and monitoring of 
an organization's IT infrastructure. These logs are crucial for ensuring 
the security, compliance, and operational integrity of an infrastructure.

## Locating Application Performance Monitoring Audit Logs

To locate APM Audit Logs, from the initial dashboard navigate to the menu on the left side. 
Find the heading `Application Performance Monitoring` and under this, you'll find `Audit logs`.

Here, you can use this page to retrieve and search internal stack-level activities 
based on event type, IP address, and name within your infrastructure metrics stack. 
Additionally, you can organize them by name and display events from the preceding 30 days. 

Here are a few examples of the available information: someone has recently started 
using a visualizer, accepted an invitation to join a stack, or made changes to their 
stack configuration. Finally, towards the bottom of the page, you'll have the option 
to download audit log results in either CSV or JSON format for archiving or auditing purposes.
