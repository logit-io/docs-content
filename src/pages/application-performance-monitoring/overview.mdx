# Application Performance Monitoring Overview

## What is Application Performance Monitoring (APM)?

APM provides insights into the performance of business-critical applications. 
Often these insights consist of metrics that capture CPU usage, response time, 
memory usage, network latency, rest call performance, slow classes, etc.

An effective APM platform will ensure that engineers can build intuitive reporting 
dashboards that reflect not only network performance and timeouts but also displays 
slow application launches affecting client-side satisfaction on top of offering defined 
crucial flows in order to track performance changes over time.

By conducting regular analysis of performance metrics you can also subsequently 
improve your application's user experience by pinpointing UI unresponsiveness.

## The APM Stack Architecture

A stack refers to the combination of software components, technologies, 
and services that make up your application's technology stack or architecture.
Logit.io provides you with an APM stack pre-configured with various nodes for 
high-performance and resilient ingestion, storage and visualization.

![APM Stack Overview](@/images/help/apm/overview/apm-stack.png)

### Ingestion Pipeline Layer

The ingestion pipeline is responsible for collecting data from various 
sources and sending it to a central location for processing and storage. 
The ingestion pipeline typically includes components like data collectors, 
agents, and connectors that can pull data from sources such as applications, 
servers, databases, logs, and external services.

#### Jaeger Collector

The Jaeger collector service within the Logit.io APM stack receives the 
traces from external Jaeger agents and forwards them to the ingestion pipeline 
to later be persisted by the storage database.

#### Kafka

Logit.io provides your APM stack with multiple Kafka nodes 
for high-performance and reliable ingestion. The Jaeger collector is pre-configured 
to pass the received traces to Kafka for processing.

#### Jaeger Ingester

The Jaeger ingester service reads the processed traces from Kafka and 
writes them to the storage database for persistence.

### Storage Layer

APM uses OpenSearch as a persistent storage database for storing the received spans 
in a structured format, making it available for analysis using the Jaeger visualizer.

### Visualization Layer

Logit.io provides the Jaeger visualizer as part of the APM stack for 
visualizing your distributed traces.

## Working with your APM stack

### Launching APM

You can launch the Jaeger visualizer to view your APM stack's data by pressing the `Launch APM` 
button found at the top of your Logit.io stack settings page:

If you have more than one Logit.io stack then you can also find this button directly on your dashboard:

## Stack Plan

Below the `Application Performance Monitoring` header on the side navigation, 
found within your stack settings, you will find the `Overview` APM page. 
This will detail your stack plan, including how many spans per month your 
plan allows, the retention time period for stored data, and the versions of 
individual software components included with your APM stack.

## View Statistics

Under the `Application Performance Monitoring` header on the side navigation, 
or from the stack settings overview page, you will find a link to the APM `Statistics` page.

The APM statistics page provides various statistics relating to your APM usage, including 
the total volume and span count collected today, historic usage, overusage based on your 
stack's current plan, and a more detailed usage table.

## Managing your APM Services

To the far right of the APM section, you will find the 'manage stack' button. 
Clicking this link will take you to your stack details, from here you can view 
your stack version information as well as other capabilities. 

Within this section, you can rebuild or delete your stack, if necessary. You 
can also, manage the data storage region for your Logit.io stacks, read more 
about this [here](/account-administration/subscriptions-management-usage/accounts/data-storage-regions). 
As well as this, you can view your stack ID and your spans per month according to your current plan.
