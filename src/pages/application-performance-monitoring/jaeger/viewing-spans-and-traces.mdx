# How to view your spans & traces?

Jaeger is a powerful distributed tracing tool system that helps 
developers monitor and troubleshoot complex, microservices-based 
architectures. This article will show how to utilize Jaeger with 
Logit.io and how to view your spans and traces.

## Working with your APM Stack/Jaeger

To locate your APM stack in Logit.io, from the initial dashboard 
scroll down, until you reach the Application Performance Monitoring 
(APM) section (see image below). Here you can view your entire APM stack.

Within this section of your dashboard, you will find Jaeger under the 
heading Services. To launch Jaeger, select the Launch link next to Jaeger, 
this will take you to Jaeger UI as shown below.

Once you've accumulated a few traces in Jaeger, you can easily inspect and 
analyze them within Jaeger's UI. ensure your date range, located on the 
right side of Jaeger, aligns with the time you captured the traces.

Jaeger is designed to give you a tailored experience in visualizing traces 
and spans. Leverage the compare tab to view insightful graphs that 
highlight your application's performance.

This allows you to focus on key metrics and discard unnecessary noise. 
For instance, you might want to monitor the end-to-end latency of 
your services to identify any potential bottlenecks.
