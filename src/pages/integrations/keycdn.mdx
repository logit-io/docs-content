## KeyCDN Logging Overview

KeyCDN is a content delivery network (CDN) that offers one of the lowest 
priced solutions in the content delivery marketplace. Their CDN allows you 
to deliver content to your visitors at a much faster rate than 
traditional image/content serving methods.

Their platform is home to advanced features including real-time analytics, 
two factor authentication, Let's Encrypt SSL and HTTP/2 compatibility. 
KeyCDN is a popular solution which is only helped by their many ready to 
launch integrations for Magento, WordPress, Drupal and a whole host of 
additional site hosting services.

KeyCDN logs contain vital information on how each HTTP request is sent to 
the service. These logs include all of the following fields; HTTP Status Code, 
IP, POP, User & Zone ID, Organisation and TLS Version used, as well as 
many other additional fields.

KeyCDN created log files are not automatically parsed, their data is formatted 
as raw unstructured text that requires processing in an external tool 
such as [Logstash](/integrations/logstash). When you're tracking in excess 
of ten different metrics per log line, it is easy to see why this would 
be hard to analyse without an external system.

Thanks to our hosted log management platform providing Logstash, Elasticsearch 
and Kibana, Logit.io makes parsing and analysing your KeyCDN logs easy and efficient. 

If you need any further assistance in sending your logs from KeyCDN to Logstash
