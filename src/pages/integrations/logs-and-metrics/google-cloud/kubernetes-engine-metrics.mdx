<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Vmagent is a tiny but mighty agent which helps you collect metrics from various sources and store them in VictoriaMetrics.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Prerequisites

  This guide assumes you already have a GKE cluster created with [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads/) and
  [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed.

  ### Verify your version of Helm

  Use the Helm version command to verify your version of Helm

  ```cmd copy
  helm version
  ```

  ### Add VictoriaMetrics Helm Chart

  Run the following to add the Victoria Metrics Helm chart.

  ```cmd copy
  helm repo add vm https://victoriametrics.github.io/helm-charts/
  ```

  ### Export default configuration yaml

  Export the default configuration to a yaml file so that we can make an edit.

  ```cmd copy
  helm show values vm/victoria-metrics-agent >> vmagent-kubernetes.yml
  ```

  ### Add remoteWriteUrls

  Open the exported configuration in a text editor to add in the remoteWriteUrls.

  You will need to edit Line 65 of the vmagent-kubernetes.yml 

  From:

  ```yml copy
  # WARN: need to specify at least one remote write url or one multi tenant url
  remoteWriteUrls: []
  # remoteWriteUrls:
  #   - http://vm-insert:8480/insert/0/prometheus
  #   - http://prometheus:8480/insert/0/prometheus
  ```

  To:

  ```yml copy
  # WARN: need to specify at least one remote write url or one multi tenant url
  remoteWriteUrls: ["https://{{metricsUsername}}:{{metricsPassword}}@{{metrics_id}}-vm.logit.io:{{vmAgentPort}}/api/v1/write"]
  # remoteWriteUrls:
  #   - http://vm-insert:8480/insert/0/prometheus
  #   - http://prometheus:8480/insert/0/prometheus
  ```

  ### install Helm chart

  You are now ready to install the helm chart.

  ```cmd copy
  helm --namespace=victoriametrics install vmagent vm/victoria-metrics-agent --create-namespace -f vmagent-kubernetes.yml
  ```

</Steps>

## GKE Metrics Overview

Google Cloud's Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a robust and scalable platform that empowers organizations to manage containerized 
applications using Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system. GKE seamlessly automates the deployment, scaling, and 
operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing high availability and reducing the need for manual tasks.

GKE Metrics provide critical insights into the health, performance, and availability of applications and infrastructure. These metrics 
help monitor resource usage, optimize costs, and improve security, ensuring that your environments are efficient and secure.

As a centralized platform, GKE also supports integration with Logit.io, enhancing your capabilities to monitor, analyze, and visualize 
Kubernetes metrics. Our platform simplifies the aggregation of these metrics, offering advanced analytics tools to help you make 
data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.

Effortlessly transmitting your GCloud Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Metrics data to Logit.io is a critical step in achieving 
comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization for your Kubernetes clusters. With Logit.io, you can coordinate, 
centralize and analyze your GKE Metrics, allowing for real-time insights into resource utilization, cluster performance, 
and application behaviour. Logit.io's [GCP logging](https://logit.io/solutions/gcp-logging/) supports 
a large backbone of Google metrics and log integrations for top performance.
