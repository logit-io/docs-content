Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Configure a pfSense firewall to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>  
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure pfSense Logging

  __Configure the pfSense firewall to log to a syslog server running Filebeat:__

  On your pfSense firewall interface navigate to "Status" -> "System Logs" -> "Settings"

  In Settings under the __General Logging Options__ set the log message format to __syslog(RFC 5424, with RFC 3339 microsecond-precision timestamps)__

  In Settings under __Remote Logging Options__ ensure the following configuration:

  * Enable Remote Logging: Enabled
  * Source Address: Default (any)
  * IP Protocol: IPV4
  * Remote Log Servers: FILEBEAT-IP-ADDRESS:514
  * Remote Syslog Contents: Everything

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

    ```yml copy filename="filebeat.yml" showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
    ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs:
    - type: udp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:514"
      enabled: true

      fields:
        type: pfsense
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 12h

    # ================================== Outputs ===================================
    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true
    ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

### pfSense Overview

The pfSense firewall is designed to offer advanced network security features for enterprise environments by safeguarding against 
cyber threats and unauthorized access. In order to effectively monitor and analyze network activity, it is crucial to have a 
dependable and efficient log management solution. The pfSense firewall generates logs that record important details about network 
traffic, threats, and user activity.

To manage these logs efficiently, organizations can employ Filebeat, an open-source shipping tool, to transfer logs from pfSense 
firewalls to various destinations such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch. Filebeat is widely used due to its reliability 
and minimal memory footprint. It is also compatible and easy to use.

To transfer pfSense firewall logs to Filebeat, organizations can configure the firewall to forward logs to a syslog server and 
then utilize Filebeat to collect and forward log data to Elasticsearch or other destinations. This process involves configuring 
a syslog server to receive the logs, configuring the firewall to send logs to the syslog server, and configuring Filebeat to 
collect and forward the logs from the syslog server to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

In summary, utilizing Filebeat to send pfSense firewall logs to various destinations, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and 
OpenSearch, is a dependable and effective log management solution. By configuring the firewall to forward logs to a syslog server 
and utilizing Filebeat to collect and forward the logs to Elasticsearch or other destinations, organizations can gain insights into 
network traffic, threats, and user activity, and take action to protect their networks against cyber threats and unauthorized access.
