Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  This guide was initially created using `Ruby (v 2.2)` / `Rails (v4.2)` and subsequently tested on `Ruby (v3.4.4)` / `Rails (v8.0.2)`. 
  This guide also uses `logstash-logger -v 0.26.1`. There are instructions for installing this gem in this guide.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Creating an Application (Optional)

  A sample application will be created that will demonstrate sending logs to Logit.io 
  Once you have installed Ruby and Rails (see the [official guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html) if you need assistance), 
  create the application with the following command in your terminal:

  ```cmd copy
  rails new sample_app
  ```
  Navigate to the new application folder.

  ```cmd copy
  cd sample_app
  ```

  The next step is to create a controller where the code will be entered for 
  sending a log to Logit.io. The following command, will create a controller called `pages`.
  
  ```cmd copy
  rails generate controller pages
  ```
  
  The new controller has been created in the app/controllers folder with the 
  name `pages_controller.rb`. Open this file using a text editor, the controller 
  is blank with just the following text contained inside the file.
  
  ```rb copy showLineNumbers
  class PagesController < ApplicationController
  end
  ```
  
  An action called `home` should be added to the controller. Some text will 
  be added to ensure that the application is running correctly. 
  The code inside the controller will look as follows:
  
  ```rb copy showLineNumbers
  class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
    message = "Logging test!"
    @greeting = message
    end
  end
  ```
  
  Next a view needs to be created for the action. Copy the file `mailer.text.erb` 
  from the `app/views/layouts` folder into the `app/views/pages` folder. 

  Rename the copied file to `home.html.erb`. Open the copied file with a text 
  editor, remove all existing content and replace with the following code:
  
  ```erb copy showLineNumbers filename="home.html.erb"
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <h1>Ruby logger test app!</h1>
  <p><%= @greeting %></p>
  </html>
  ```
  
  The `home.html.erb` file is a simple view that will be displayed after the 
  code in the home method of the pages controller has actioned. A root request 
  must be added to ensure that this happens and is to be added to `routes.rb` 
  located in the config folder: `config/routes.rb`. Replace the contents of the file with the following:
  
  ```rb copy
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

    # Reveal health status on /up that returns 200 if the app boots with no exceptions, otherwise 500.
    # Can be used by load balancers and uptime monitors to verify that the app is live.
    get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check

    root to: 'pages#home'
  end
  ```

  ### Setup Logstash Logger Plugin

  Using CMD Prompt or Terminal editor, the user must be in the `sample_app`
  directory and enter the following command:
        
  ```cmd copy
  gem install logstash-logger -v 0.26.1
  ```
        
  There is a file in the top level directory of the application called `Gemfile`. 
  When opening this file with a text editor many references to different gems can be seen e.g.

  ```cmd copy    
  gem 'rails', '~> 5.2.1'   
  ```

  A reference is required for the newly installed `logstash-logger` 
  gem and needs to be added, this is done as follows:

  ```cmd copy
  # Use logstash-logger
  gem 'logstash-logger', '~> 0.26.1'
  ```

  A reference is also required at the very top of the `pages_controller`. 
  The code to do this is as follows:

  ```rb copy
  require 'logstash-logger'
  ```

  ### Add TCP-TLS Logging

  The following code needs to be added to the `home` method in `pages_controller`, this code does the actual logging. If you 
  are logged into your Logit.io account, the host and port values will already be populated with the correct values for your stack.
        
  ```rb copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /"@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes"/
  tcp_logger = LogStashLogger.new(
    type: :tcp, 
    host: '@logstash.host', 
    port: "@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes",
    ssl_enable: true)

  file_logger = LogStashLogger.new(
    type: :file, 
    path: 'log/logstashtest.log', 
    sync: true)

  file_logger.error message
  tcp_logger.error message
  ```

  This code sets up an instance of the logstash server logger and also a 
  logstash file logger (which writes to a file called `logstashtest.log`). 
  The `message` variable, which is set earlier in the code, is sent to 
  both the server and the file as an error message for demonstration purposes.
      
  Below is the full code for the `pages_controller` with the TCP-TLS logging now added:
      
  ```rb copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /"@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes"/
  require 'logstash-logger'

  class PagesController < ApplicationController
      def home
          message = "Logging test!"
          @greeting = message
                  
          tcp_logger = LogStashLogger.new(
            type: :tcp,
            host: '@logstash.host', 
            port: "@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes",
            ssl_enable: true
          )

          file_logger = LogStashLogger.new(
            type: :file,
            path: 'log/logstashtest.log',
            sync: true)
          
          file_logger.error message
          tcp_logger.error message
      end
  end
  ```

  The final part of the setup is to enter the following command into your terminal:

  ```cmd copy
  rails server
  ```

  This starts the application. Opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` will 
  display a page with `Ruby logger test app! Logging test!` on it. 

  The demo log (`Logging test!` defined earlier) is written to the `logstashtest.log` file 
  and sent to your stack (which can be viewed using OpenSearch Dashboards). The 
  `logstashtest.log` file is found in the `sample_app\log` folder.

## Ruby Logging Overview

Ruby is an open sources object oriented programming language created in 
the mid 90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It is used by some of the web's most 
popular sites including Shopify, Twitch, Twitter, Airbnb and Github.

Ruby is well known for being easily comprehensible and has a syntax 
comparable to that of C and Java, it is also equally suited for frontend 
and backend development. Ruby also supports the majority of operating 
systems including Linux, Windows & Mac.

Ruby log events and errors can often be seen in two common locations, 
inline with the program's execution and in separate log files in an 
output such as /var/log/ruby.log

Ruby log levels include the following five statuses listed in 
decreasing priority order; `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`.

For live debugging, being able to see your errors in the program's 
execution is useful but for longer term log management an external 
solution is required for efficient processing, parsing and reporting.

Thanks to our [ELK as a Service platform](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-as-a-service), 
Logit.io makes parsing and managing your logs from Ruby easy and also 
provides actionable insights that can be used by your entire engineering 
and development team. Our platform is able to centralise all of your 
logs across numerous programming languages, tools, 
and cloud services that you use daily.
