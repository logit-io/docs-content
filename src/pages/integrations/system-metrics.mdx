Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship system metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the plugin

  The default `telegraf.conf` configuration file is thousands of lines long so, for simplicity, we will create a new
  configuration file for this guide.
  Create a new text file and copy the configuration details below into it and save it as `telegraf-demo.conf` in 
  the directory where Telegraf has been installed.

  The configuration below will scrape a selection of system metrics from the machine you have installed Telegraf 
  on and these will be sent to your Logit.io stack. Metrics include CPU, memory and disk usage and system metrics 
  such as system load and uptime.

    We are going to use the `win_perf_counters` input plugin to scrape the CPU usage metric from your Windows host.
  
    ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
    # Input plugin to report Windows services info.
    # This plugin ONLY supports Windows
    [[inputs.win_services]]
      ## Names of the services to monitor. Leave empty to monitor all the available services on the host. Globs accepted. Case sensitive.
      service_names = [
        "LanmanServer",
        "TermService",
        "Win*",
      ]
      excluded_service_names = ['WinRM'] # optional, list of service names to exclude

    # Windows Performance Counters plugin.
    # These are the recommended method of monitoring system metrics on windows,
    # as the regular system plugins (inputs.cpu, inputs.mem, etc.) rely on WMI,
    # which utilize more system resources.

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />

  ### Launch Metrics to View Data

  Click the 'Launch Metrics' button below to open the infrastructure metrics visualizer. 
  
  <LaunchVisualizer type="metrics" />
  
  Once opened, click on the Explore option in the left-hand menu:
  ![Grafana Explore](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-explore.png)
  
  <Tabs items={["Windows", "Linux, macOS"]}>
    <Tab>
      Under the Metric header you will see 'Select metric'. Open the drop-down menu 
      and scroll to and select 'win_mem_Available_Bytes':
      ![Grafana Select Metric](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-metrics-win_mem.png)
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      Under the Metric header you will see 'Select metric'. Open the drop-down menu 
      and scroll to and select 'mem_available':
      ![Grafana Select Metric](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-metrics-mem.png)
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Click on the blue Run query button near the top-right of the screen:
  ![Grafana Run Query](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-run-query.png)

  You will now see the metric data displayed and if you click on the blue Run query button this will be updated.
  You can set this to automatically update by clicking on the arrow on the blue button and chosing the interval 
  at which you want the data to be updated.

  When you want to stop Telegraf sending metric data press Ctrl + C in the terminal app / Powershell.
