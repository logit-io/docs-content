Use OpenTelemetry to easily send C++ traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for C++ by referring to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/getting-started/). 
  You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.
  
  OTLP HTTP Exporter settings:

  ```cpp copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_http_exporter_factory.h"
  #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_http_exporter_options.h"

  namespace otlp = opentelemetry::exporter::otlp;

  otlp::OtlpHttpExporterOptions opts;
  opts.url = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port";
  opts.http_headers = "Authorization=Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString";

  auto exporter = otlp::OtlpHttpExporterFactory::Create(opts);
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with C++ please refer to the 
  [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/exporters/).
