Use OpenTelemetry to easily send C++ traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for C++ by referring to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/getting-started/). 
  You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.
  
  OTLP gRPC Exporter settings:

  ```cpp copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_grpc_exporter_factory.h"
  #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_grpc_exporter_options.h"

  namespace otlp = opentelemetry::exporter::otlp;

  otlp::OtlpGrpcExporterOptions opts;
  opts.endpoint = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port";
  opts.metadata.insert(std::pair<std::string, std::string>(
      "authorization", "Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString"));

  auto exporter = otlp::OtlpGrpcExporterFactory::Create(opts);
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with C++ please refer to the 
  [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/exporters/).
