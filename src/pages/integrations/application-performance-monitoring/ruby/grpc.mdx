Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Ruby traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for Ruby by referring to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/ruby/getting-started/). 

  To automatically instrument your Ruby application and send traces to your Logit.io 
  Stack you just need to ensure the Environment variables or system properties are added correctly.

  The variables that need to be updated to allow the traces to be sent to your Logit.io Stack are shown below.

  #### Environment Variables

  ```env copy /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.protocol/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER = otlp
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL = @opentelemetry.protocol
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS = Authorization=Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with Ruby please refer to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/ruby/exporters/).

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your traces
