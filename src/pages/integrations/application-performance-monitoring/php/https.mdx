Use OpenTelemetry to easily send PHP traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for PHP by referring to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/php/getting-started/). 
  
  You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.
  
  OTLP HTTP/S Exporter settings:

  ```php copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  <?php

  require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

  use OpenTelemetry\Contrib\Otlp\OtlpHttpTransportFactory;
  use OpenTelemetry\Contrib\Otlp\SpanExporter;
  use OpenTelemetry\SDK\Trace\SpanProcessor\SimpleSpanProcessor;
  use OpenTelemetry\SDK\Trace\TracerProvider;

  $transport = (new OtlpHttpTransportFactory())->create(
    'https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port', 
    'application/x-protobuf', 
    ['Authorization' => 'Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString']);
  $exporter = new SpanExporter($transport);

  $tracerProvider =  new TracerProvider(
      new SimpleSpanProcessor($exporter)
  );
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with PHP please refer to 
  the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/php/exporters/).
