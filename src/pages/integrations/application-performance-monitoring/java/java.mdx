Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Java traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  To automatically instrument your Java application and send traces 
  to your   Logit.io Stack you just need to ensure the Environment 
  variables or system properties are added correctly.

  The full list of environment variable and system property names can be found 
  [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md#opentelemetry-resource). 
  
  The variables that need to be updated to allow the traces to be sent 
  to your Logit.io Stack are shown below. Be sure to update the path to 
  the location of the OpenTelemetry javaagent jar file and set your service name.

  <Tabs items={["HTTPS", "gRPC"]}>
  
  <Tab>
    <JavaOtlpExporterSettings protocol="http" port="@opentelemetry.httpsPort" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <JavaOtlpExporterSettings protocol="grpc" port="@opentelemetry.grpcPort" />
  </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your traces

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="apm" utmCampaign="java" source="apm_java_grpc" />
