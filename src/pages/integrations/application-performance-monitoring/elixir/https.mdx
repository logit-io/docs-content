Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Elixir traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for Elixir by referring 
  to the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/getting-started/). 
  You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.
  
  OTLP HTTP/S Exporter settings:

  ```elixir copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  config :opentelemetry_exporter,
  otlp_protocol: :http_protobuf,
  otlp_endpoint: "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.httpsPort",
  otlp_headers: [{"authorization", "Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString" }]
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with Elixir please see the 
  [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/exporters/).

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your traces
