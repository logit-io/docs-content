Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Go traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  This guide uses the 
  [OpenTelemetry Go collector example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/main/example/otel-collector/main.go) 
  application as its starting point with some modifications to allow the traces to be sent to your Logit.io Stack.

  This code is added to `main.go` and when run will send the example traces to your Logit.io Stack to be viewed in Jaeger.
