Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Erlang traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for Erlang by referring to the 
  [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/getting-started/). 
  
  You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.
  
  OTLP HTTP/S Exporter settings:

  ```erlang copy showLineNumbers filename="sys.config.src" /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
  %% config/sys.config.src
  [
  {opentelemetry,
    [{span_processor, batch},
    {traces_exporter, otlp}]},

  {opentelemetry_exporter,
    [{otlp_protocol, http_protobuf},
    {otlp_headers, [{"authorization", "Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString"}]}
    {otlp_endpoint, "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.httpsPort"}]}]}
  ].
  ```

  For more information about exporter configuration with Erlang please see the 
  [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/exporters/).
