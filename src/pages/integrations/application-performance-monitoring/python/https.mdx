Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Python traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Getting Started

  The official [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/getting-started/) 
  contains a lot of useful guidance for how to implement tracing.

  The purpose of this document is to explain how to send your telemetry 
  data to the OpenTelemetry Collector hosted by Logit.io. 

  The snippet below shows a breakdown of the Command Line 
  Arguments required to send the trace data to Logit.io
          
  ```yml copy /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/ /@opentelemetry.protocol/
  # The instrumented application is called using this command
  opentelemetry-instrument

  # The traces are exported to the OpenTelemetry Collector
  --traces_exporter otlp

  # This is where Logit.io host the OpenTelemetry Collector
  --exporter_otlp_endpoint https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port

  # This can be either grpc or http/protobuf
  --exporter_otlp_traces_protocol @opentelemetry.protocol

  # We authenticate the access to the collector using Basic authentication in an http header (which is safe because we are using the https protocol)
  --exporter_otlp_traces_headers "Authorization=Basic%20@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString"

  # If we don't set this argument to console (and we aren't interested in sending the metrics to Logit.io) then we could receive errors in the Python IDE
  --metrics_exporter console

  # If we don't set the service name it will appear in Jaeger as 'unknown_service'
  --service_name your-service-name

  # an example of the application being instrumented (your own app details should be entered here)
  python -m flask run -p 8080
  ```

  So the full command including arguments is:

  ```cmd copy /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.port/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/ /@opentelemetry.protocol/
  opentelemetry-instrument --traces_exporter otlp --exporter_otlp_endpoint https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.port --exporter_otlp_traces_protocol @opentelemetry.protocol --exporter_otlp_traces_headers "Authorization=Basic%20@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString" --metrics_exporter console --service_name your-service-name python -m flask run -p 8080
  ```

  ### Alternative to Command Line arguments

  Instead of specifying the arguments when calling the 
  instrumentation application you can also set these as 
  [Environment Variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/automatic/agent-config/#environment-variables).

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your traces
