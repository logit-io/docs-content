## .NET Core Traces Overview

.NET Core is an open-source platform created by Microsoft for development 
across Linux, macOS & Windows and makes .NET run as a cross-platform 
framework. It can be used to write APIs, and ASP.NET websites.

Tracing & tailing logs for .NET Core can often encounter difficulties when 
debugging over longer time periods. If these log messages are being 
recorded across distributed environments then it can make centralising your 
logs nearly impossible for logging analysis and management at scale.

The Logit.io platform offers [hosted OpenSearch](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-opensearch) 
which makes visualising .NET Core log instances far more streamlined than comparable 
logging solutions. We believe that monitoring & analysis play a crucial role 
in maintaining the health of your applications across the cloud & on-premise.
