The OpenTelemetry Collector allows you to send logs, metrics and traces to your Logit.io stacks.

<Steps>
  ### About the OpenTelemetry Collector

  The OpenTelemetry Collector enables you to quickly and securely ship your data according to your specific configuration requirements 
  and facilitates the forwarding of logs, metrics, and trace data directly to Logit.io's observability platform.

  Setting up and operating the OpenTelemetry Collector offers multiple benefits, such as:

  **Simplified setup:** With Logit.io's pre-configured OTEL stack config, you can streamline your data transmission setup.

  **Comprehensive data collection:** This tool gathers logs, metrics, and tracing information, offering an all-encompassing platform for 
  data observability to enhance monitoring and optimization efforts.

  ### Learn how to instrument your application

  Understand how to instrument your application with OpenTelemetry with this official guide 
  [Getting Started for Developers](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/dev/) or continue and use the Demo App in the next step.

  ### Install the OpenTelemetry Demo App (Optional)

  The Demo App generates logs, traces and metrics for a sample application in cases where you don't want to instrument your application at this stage.

  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you don't already have it.

  Clone the Demo repository

  ```cmd copy
  git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo.git
  ```
  Change to the Demo folder

  ```cmd copy
  cd opentelemetry-demo/
  ```

  ### OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration

  The config below will be pre-configured if you have launched this source integration from your stack dashboard.
        
  If not, make sure to replace the following placeholders with the correct details: `<your-opentelemetry-username>`, `<your-opentelemetry-password>`,`<your-elasticsearch-username>`, `<your-elasticsearch-password>`, `<your-log-stack-id>`, `<your-metrics-username>`, `<your-metrics-password>`, `<your-metrics-stack-id>`, `<your-opentelemetry-endpoint-address>` and `<your-opentelemetry-endpoint-port>`.

  Copy the configuration file below (making the above changes if necessary) and overwrite the contents of otelcol-config.yml (this file can be found in the otelcollector folder where you installed the OpenTelemetry Collector demo application e.g. opentelemetry-demo/src/otelcollector/otelcol-config.yml).

    ```yaml copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.username:strip_quotes/ /@opentelemetry.password:strip_quotes/ /@elasticsearch.username:strip_quotes/ /@elasticsearch.password:strip_quotes/ /@logs_id-es.logit.io/ /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id-vm.logit.io/ /@vmAgentPort/ /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:strip_quotes/ /@opentelemetry.grpcPort/

  ```

  ### Run the OpenTelemetry Demo App (Optional)

  If you are using the Demo app, you can start it by running the following command in a Terminal (make sure you run it in the opentelemetry-demo folder):

  ```cmd copy
  docker compose up --force-recreate --remove-orphans --detach
  ```

  You can now view the Demo App: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and Logs, Metrics and Traces are being sent to your stacks.

### OpenTelemetry Collector Overview

The OpenTelemetry Collector, renowned for its efficiency and streamlined memory footprint, is becoming the preferred choice for funneling logs, metrics, 
and tracing data into observability platforms. As a pivotal component of the comprehensive suite of open-source telemetry tools, it builds upon the 
foundational features of predecessors, crafted in the efficient Go programming language. The Collector excels in ingesting, processing, tailing, and 
exporting telemetry data, positioning itself as a versatile and essential tool in the telemetry data pipeline.

Originating from the integration of best practices and core functionalities from earlier telemetry tools, the OpenTelemetry Collector is engineered to 
offer flexibility and robustness in handling telemetry data. Unlike its early versions, which were limited in scope and destination options for telemetry 
data, recent iterations have expanded its capabilities, enabling seamless integration with a variety of data processing and storage systems, including 
but not limited to Redis and Kafka.

Despite the Collector's adaptability and comprehensive feature set, an improperly configured OpenTelemetry setup can lead to intricate issues in telemetry 
data management. These complications might manifest as unwieldy registry files or errors in file handling when logs are deleted or renamed, posing 
significant challenges in maintaining a clean and efficient logging environment. Additionally, the task of monitoring and managing multiple telemetry 
pipelines can be daunting for those operating their own telemetry infrastructure, prompting some to explore managed observability solutions as an 
effective way to alleviate these burdens.
