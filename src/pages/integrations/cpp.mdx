Use OpenTelemetry to easily send C++ traces to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ## APM
  ### Install Integration

    You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for C++ by referring to the 
    [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/getting-started/). 
    You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.

    OTLP HTTP Exporter settings:

    ```cpp copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
    #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_https_exporter_factory.h"
    #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_https_exporter_options.h"

    namespace otlp = opentelemetry::exporter::otlp;

    otlp::OtlpHttpExporterOptions opts;
    opts.url = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.httpsPort";
    opts.http_headers = "Authorization=Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString";

    auto exporter = otlp::OtlpHttpExporterFactory::Create(opts);
    ```

    For more information about exporter configuration with C++ please refer to the 
    [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/cpp/exporters/).

    OTLP gRPC Exporter settings:

    ```cpp copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.grpcPort/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
    #include "opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_grpc_exporter_factory.h"

    namespace otlp = opentelemetry::exporter::otlp;

    otlp::OtlpGrpcExporterOptions opts;
    opts.endpoint = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.grpcPort";
    opts.metadata.insert(std::pair<std::string, std::string>(
        "authorization", "Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString"));

    auto exporter = otlp::OtlpGrpcExporterFactory::Create(opts);
    ```
