Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship YouTube metrics to your Logit.io stacks.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy filename="telegraf.conf" showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  [[inputs.youtube]]
    ## List of channels to monitor.
    channels = [
      "UCBR8-60-B28hp2BmDPdntcQ",
      "UCnrgOD6G0y0_rcubQuICpTQ"
    ]

    ## List of videos to monitor.
    videos = [
      "gjoHHYnXdqs",
      "OoCsY8odmpM"
    ]

    ## YouTube API key.
    # api_key = ""
  
  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

### Telegraf YouTube Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Youtube metrics in a distributed environment, a solid metrics 
management solution is key. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, 
is ideally suited for this task. It can gather Youtube metrics from various sources, including 
operational Youtube instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf offers a comprehensive set of input plugins that enable users to collect diverse metrics, 
such as views, likes, dislikes, comments, and more, vital for understanding Youtube performance. 
To store and examine these harvested metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting toolkit recognized for its flexible querying language and potent data 
visualization capabilities.

The transmission of Youtube metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus requires configuring Telegraf to 
output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics 
from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Youtube metrics, 
outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from 
the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic 
querying and graphical visualization tools.
      
Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization 
can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform known for its 
monitoring and observability features, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users 
to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper dive into the metrics data, offering a 
comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues within the Youtube system.
