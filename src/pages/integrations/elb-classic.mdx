Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide 
  from Amazon will help you achieve this if you are not doing this already:

  [ELB classic to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html)

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
      
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear (remember to update the bucket name as appropriate):

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "SidID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:ListBucket"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>",
          "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>/*"
          ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## AWS ELB Classic Logging Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Classic is a streamlined process 
that empowers businesses to centralize their log and metrics data for enhanced monitoring and analysis. 

To further enhance the capabilities of your AWS environment, consider integrating [Amazon RDS](/integrations/rds) 
into your Logit.io account. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) simplifies database management, 
offering high availability, security, and scalability. 

In addition, by integrating Amazon ELB Classic logs and metrics with [CloudWatch](/integrations/cloudwatch/#metrics), 
you can set up automated responses to events and proactively address any issues that may arise. 
Efficient integration is a hallmark of Logit.io's [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging), 
which includes these integrations and more.
