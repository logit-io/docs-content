If you have logs that are in JSON format, you can send them to your Logit.io Stack using the HTTP/S API. 
This is a great way to send logs from applications that do not have a native integration with Logit.io or for custom applications.

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Send JSON logs to your Logit.io Stack via your Logit.io API endpoint.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Requirements

  - Valid JSON content
  - API key, sent in the headers. If you are logged into your Logit.io account the API key and endpoint should be automatically 
    populated in the examples below.
  - Content-Type header set as application/json
  - Either POST or PUT to https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2

  ### Send a single JSON log using curl

  <Tabs items={["Linux, macOS, DEB, RPM","Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: json" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d '{"test":"test","example": { "a": 1, "b": 2 } }'
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
    If using the command prompt you will need to escape double-quote characters with a backslash in the data field as shown in the example below.
                
    Command Prompt:
    ```cmd copy
    curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: json" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d "{\"test\":\"test\",\"example\": { \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 } }"
    ```

    Or you can send the cURL request via Powershell:
    ```ps1 copy
    curl -Method Post `
    -Uri "https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2" `
    -Headers @{
        "ApiKey" = "@apikey";
        "Content-Type" = "application/json";
        "LogType" = "json"
    } `
    -Body (@{
        test = "test";
        example = @{
            a = 1;
            b = 2
        }
    } | ConvertTo-Json)
    ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  ### Response from Logit.io

  You should expect to receive a 202 ACCEPTED response code for a successful message

  <Tabs items={["Curl command", "Windows Powershell"]} unlink>
    <Tab>
      ```cmd copy
      HTTP/1.1 202 ACCEPTED
      Content-Type: application/json
      Content-Length: 39
      Connection: keep-alive
      Server: Logit-API-Server
      Date: Wed, 27 Mar 2025 14:34:39 GMT
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
      Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
      X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
      X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

      {"message":"Message Received, Thanks"}
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
    Although essentially the same, the message format will be slightly different in Powershell:

    ```ps1 copy
    StatusCode        : 202
    StatusDescription : ACCEPTED
    Content           : {"message":"Message Received, Thanks"}

    RawContent        : HTTP/1.1 202 ACCEPTED
                        Connection: keep-alive
                        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
                        Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
                        X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
                        X-Content-Type-Options: ...
    Forms             : {}
    Headers           : {[Connection, keep-alive], [Access-Control-Allow-Origin, *], [Strict-Transport-Security,
                        max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains], [X-Xss-Protection, 1; mode=block]...}
    Images            : {}
    InputFields       : {}
    Links             : {}
    ParsedHtml        : mshtml.HTMLDocumentClass
    RawContentLength  : 39
    ```
    </Tab>
  
  </Tabs>

  ### Send JSON log files using curl

  It is also possible to test sending logs in a JSON file to Logit.io.

  Create a new file in the same directory as your command prompt and copy the snippet below and save it as `sample.json`.

  ```json copy
  {
    "name": "Jason",
    "city": "Jakarta",
    "display": "Hello there from JSON file",
    "value": 5
  }
  ```

  The following command should now be entered into the command prompt, this will send the file to Logit.io:
  <Tabs items={["Linux, macOS, DEB, RPM","Windows Powershell"]}>
    <Tab>
    ```cmd copy
    curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: json" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d @sample.json
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```ps1 copy
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2" `
      -Headers @{
          "ApiKey" = "@apikey";
          "Content-Type" = "application/json";
          "LogType" = "json"
      } `
      -Method POST `
      -Body (Get-Content -Path "sample.json" -Raw)
    ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
