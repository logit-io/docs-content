  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide from Amazon will 
  help you achieve this if you are not doing this already, you can choose the best way 
  to achieve this, but cloudwatch or cloudtrail are a great place to start:

  [RDS Monitoring Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Monitoring.html)

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
  
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear:

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "SidID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ### Configure Logstash for Amazon ELB Classic

  <AddS3Input type="aws_rds" utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="awsrds" />
  
  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack source="rds" utmMedium="aws" utmCampaign="rds" />

## RDS Logging Overview

Integrating Amazon RDS with Logit.io is a pivotal step in ensuring efficient database monitoring. 
Logit.io's seamless support for Amazon RDS empowers you to collect and visualize log and performance 
data, enhancing the visibility and performance of your database. To create a comprehensive 
AWS ecosystem, explore our [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](/integrations/infrastructure-metrics/aws/aws-eks-metrics) 
integration to discover how Logit.io can further elevate your monitoring capabilities. 

For improved AWS security and auditing, consider implementing our [CloudTrail](/integrations/log-management/aws/cloudtrail) 
integration to gain detailed visibility into API actions and events across your AWS resources. 

Logit.io ensures that these integrations work in tandem as part of their [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/).
