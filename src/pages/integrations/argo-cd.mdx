Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Argo CD metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Expose Argo CD Metrics

  Follow the instructions here to expose the [Argo CD Metrics](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/) in the Prometheus format.

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Read metrics from the argo metrics endpoint
  [[inputs.prometheus]]
    ## An array of urls to scrape metrics from.
    urls = ["http://argocd-metrics:8082/metrics"]
  
  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

### Telegraf Argo CD Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze JTI OpenConfig metrics across a distributed environment, it's essential to have a robust and 
efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, fits this requirement well. 
It can gather JTI OpenConfig metrics from numerous sources such as operational routers and switches, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf features a wide range of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from various sources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, 
network traffic, and more, all critical to understanding JTI OpenConfig performance. To store and scrutinize these collected metrics, 
organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and powerful data 
visualization capabilities.

To relay JTI OpenConfig metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process includes setting up Telegraf to gather JTI OpenConfig 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users 
to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look at the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential issues in the JTI OpenConfig system.
