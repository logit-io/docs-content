Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Apache Mesos metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy filename="telegraf.conf" showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  # Telegraf plugin for gathering metrics from N Mesos masters
  [[inputs.mesos]]
    ## Timeout, in ms.
    timeout = 100

    ## A list of Mesos masters.
    masters = ["http://localhost:5050"]

    ## Master metrics groups to be collected, by default, all enabled.
    master_collections = [
      "resources",
      "master",
      "system",
      "agents",
      "frameworks",
      "framework_offers",
      "tasks",
      "messages",
      "evqueue",
      "registrar",
      "allocator",
    ]

    ## A list of Mesos slaves, default is []
    # slaves = []

    ## Slave metrics groups to be collected, by default, all enabled.
    # slave_collections = [
    #   "resources",
    #   "agent",
    #   "system",
    #   "executors",
    #   "tasks",
    #   "messages",
    # ]

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

### Telegraf Apache Mesos Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of Apache Mesos metrics across multiple systems, it's crucial to have a robust and efficient metrics 
management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent specifically designed for collecting and reporting metrics, fits this role perfectly. 
It can gather Apache Mesos metrics from numerous sources such as operational Apache Mesos instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf boasts an extensive range of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from various sources like CPU usage, memory utilization, 
network traffic, and more. These metrics are vital for understanding Apache Mesos performance. To store and examine these harvested metrics, 
organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and impressive 
data visualization capabilities.

To relay Apache Mesos metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Apache Mesos 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deep-dive into the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and 
potential issues within the Apache Mesos system.
