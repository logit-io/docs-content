Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Filebeat is an open source shipping agent that lets you ship AWS 
  Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) container Logs to one or more destinations, including Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Prerequisites

  Firstly Make sure you have the aws cli, eksctl & kubectl installed on local 
  machine using the [following guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).

  Also make sure you have setup aws configure with your AWS credentials. 

  To do this run the following command in your aws terminal.

  ```cmd copy
  aws configure
  ```

  When you type this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: 
  access key, secret access key, AWS Region, and output format. This information is 
  stored in a profile named default. This profile is used when you run commands, 
  unless you specify another one.

  ### Connecting to the cluster

  Update your config by running the following command. Replace `<enter_region>` and `<enter_name>` with your AWS cluster region and name.
        
  ```cmd copy
  aws eks --region <enter_region> update-kubeconfig --name <enter_name>
  ```

  Check you can connect to your cluster by running the following command:

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl get svc
  ```

  ### Deploy Filebeat

  You're going to need the filebeat deployment manifest.

  ```cmd copy
  curl -L -O cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

  Now you have the manifest we need to add your Stack Logstash endpoint details. 
  
  Open the file in a text editor and around lines 58 you'll see the environment variables that need changing.

  ```yml copy
  env:
    - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
      value: "guid-ls.logit.io"
    - name: BEATS_PORT
      value: "00000"
  ```

  After updating the code should look as below.

  ```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  env:
    - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
      value: ["@logstash.host"]
    - name: BEATS_PORT
      value: ["@logstash.sslPort"]
  ```

  Exit and save the file.

  ### Apply your updates

  Now we're going to apply the file to the cluster.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    If you need to apply further updates after running the apply command 
    you may need to remove the yaml file, make your changes and then apply again.
  </Callout>

  ### Confirm Deployment

  Confirm your pod has deployed, you should see output similar to that below.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl get po -A
  ```

  or

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl logs ["podname"] --namespace=kube-system
  ```

  Browse to your Kibana instance and you should see Logs arriving in your Stack.

## AWS EKS Logs Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from AWS EKS Logs streamlines the process of log management for 
Kubernetes container orchestration. With effortless integration, users can easily ship 
logs from their AWS EKS clusters to Logit.io's powerful log management and analysis platform, 
ensuring real-time visibility into their environments. This enables rapid issue resolution, 
performance optimization, and comprehensive log analysis to uncover trends and anomalies. 
Moreover, centralizing logs in Logit.io supports security monitoring, threat detection, 
and compliance adherence, ensuring a complete audit trail.

The simplicity of these integrations all work side by side within Logit.io's [AWS logging solution](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/).
