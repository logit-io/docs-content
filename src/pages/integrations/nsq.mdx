Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship NSQ metrics to your Logit.io stacks.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Read NSQ topic and channel statistics.
  [[inputs.nsq]]
    ## An array of NSQD HTTP API endpoints
    endpoints  = ["http://localhost:4151"]

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]

### Telegraf NSQ Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze NSQ metrics across multiple systems, it's vital to use a robust and efficient 
metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and sending telemetry data, 
is perfectly suited for this task. It can gather NSQ metrics from a wide array of sources, such as operational 
NSQ instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf boasts a wide range of input plugins, allowing users to collect metrics from diverse sources such as 
CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and more, all vital for comprehending NSQ performance. 
To store and examine these collected metrics, organizations can deploy Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and powerful data visualization capabilities.

To channel NSQ metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations must configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect NSQ metrics, outputting them in Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then interpreting the data 
visually using Prometheus's robust querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
performed using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform renowned for its monitoring and 
observability capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to create dynamic, 
interactive dashboards for a deeper exploration of the metrics data, offering a comprehensive understanding 
of performance trends and potential issues within the NSQ system.
