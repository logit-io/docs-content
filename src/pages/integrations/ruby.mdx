Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Get started quickly with Ruby logging using our configuration guide on how to easily ship Ruby logs to your hosted ELK Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Simple Ruby Logging

  ```ruby copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /"@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes"/
  gem install logstash-logger
  irb
  require 'logstash-logger'

  tcp_logger = LogStashLogger.new(
    type: :tcp,
    host: '@logstash.host',
    port: "@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes",
    ssl_enable: true
  )

  tcp_logger.error "This is logged as an error"
  tcp_logger.info "This is logged as info"
  tcp_logger.debug "This is logged as debug"
  tcp_logger.warn "This is logged as a warning"
  ```

  ### Launch Logs to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

<Steps>
  ## APM

  <Callout type="info">
    This sample app was created and tested with
    `ruby 3.3.4 (2024-07-09 revision be1089c8ec) [x64-mingw-ucrt]`
  </Callout>

  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install

  Create a new directory for your project and call the new directory `opentelemetry_example`.

  Open a Terminal window or Command Prompt and navigate into the new `opentelemetry_example` directory. 
  Then enter the following command.

  ```bash copy
  bundle init
  ```

  You will now see a `Gem` file has been created inside the folder.

  Create two new files in the folder and call them `app.rb` and `config.rb`. There should now be a 
  total of three files in the `opentelemetry_example` folder.

  ### Configuring the App

  Open the `Gem` file and paste in the following code, overwriting the existing content.

  ```json copy 
  # frozen_string_literal: true

  source 'http://www.rubygems.org'

  # gem "rails"

  gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
  gem 'opentelemetry-exporter-otlp'
  gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-all'
  ```

  Install the `Gems` with the following command in Terminal or the Command prompt.

  ```bash copy
  bundle install
  ```

  ### Using OpenTelemetry

  Copy and Paste the code below into `config.rb`.

  ```ruby copy filename="config.rb" /@opentelemetry.password/  /@opentelemetry.username/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/
  # config.rb

  # Define variables
  OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress"
  PORT = "@opentelemetry.httpsPort"
  OTLP_USERNAME = "@opentelemetry.username"
  OTLP_PASSWORD = "@opentelemetry.password"
  ```

  Finally copy and paste the code below into `app.rb`

  ```ruby copy filename="app.rb"
  # app.rb

  require_relative 'config'

  require "sinatra"
  require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
  require 'opentelemetry/exporter/otlp'
  require 'base64'

  # Configuration Parameters
  ENV['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT'] = "#{OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL}:#{PORT}"
  ENV['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS'] = "Authorization = Basic " + Base64.strict_encode64("#{OTLP_USERNAME}:#{OTLP_PASSWORD}")
  ENV['OTEL_SERVICE_NAME'] = "LogitTestApp"

  # Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK with OTLP Exporter
  OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
    c.use_all() # Enable all available instrumentation
  end

  # Endpoint to be called to add traces
  get "/" do
  tracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer('LogitTestService')
  
  # Start the first span
  tracer.in_span('Logit Span Test') do |span|
    span.set_attribute('First Message', 'This is a test!')
    span.set_attribute('Second Message', 'Message sent at ' + Time.now.utc.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'))

    # Start the second span within the context of the first span
    tracer.in_span('Logit Span Test 2') do |child_span|
      child_span.set_attribute('First Message', 'This is another test!')
      child_span.set_attribute('Second Message', 'Message sent at ' + Time.now.utc.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'))
    end
  end
    

  end

  # Message when starting app
  puts "Starting Logit Test App"
  ```

  ### Run the Ruby App

  Run the Ruby app with the following command in Terminal or the Command Prompt window.

  ```bash copy
  ruby app.rb
  ```

  You will see feedback from the app so that you know that is running, make a note of the
  endpoint that it is listening on.

  ![Ruby Endpoint](@/images/integrations/ruby/ruby-endpoint.png)

  Open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window and make a curl request to the listening endpoint

  ```cmd copy
  curl http://127.0.0.1:4567
  ```

  Traces will now have been sent to your Stack.

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your traces

  <LaunchVisualizer type="apm" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />
