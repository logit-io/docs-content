  ## Logs

  Send your SentinelOne logs to logit.io via logstash using the instructions below and begin searching your data
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install the SentinelOne certificate

  SentinelOne sends data in an encrypted format. 

  You need to install the SentinelOne certificate on your Filebeat server.

  ```ps1 copy
  sudo mkdir /etc/SentinelOne/certificates
  sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout /etc/filebeat/certificates/SentinelOne.key -x509 \
  -days 365 \
  -out /etc/filebeat/certificates/SentinelOne.crt
  ```

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.
        
Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat 
configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration #########################
# ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
filebeat.inputs:
- type: tcp
  max_message_size: 10MiB
  host: "0.0.0.0:6515"
  enabled: true

  fields:
    type: "sentinelone"
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 12h

# ================================== Outputs ===================================
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
  loadbalance: true
  ssl.enabled: true
```

  ### Start Filebeat

  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Configure SentinelOne to output to syslog

  To configure SentinelOne to send logs to your Syslog server, follow these steps:

  - Open the SentinelOne Admin Console
  - Select your site
  - Open the __INTEGRATIONS__ tab
  - Under Types, select __SYSLOG__
  - Toggle the button to enable SYSLOG
  - In the Host field, enter the IP address and port of your public SYSLOG server
  - Under Formatting, select CEF2
  - Save your changes

  ### Configure SentinelOne Notifications

  - Open the __NOTIFICATIONS__ tab
  - Under types choose Syslog
  - To get started we recommend enabling all notifications

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="sentinelone" source="SentinelOne" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

## SentinelOne Logging Overview

SentinelOne is an advanced endpoint security solution that provides comprehensive 
protection against cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, and other forms 
of attacks. To effectively monitor and analyze endpoint activity, it's crucial to 
have a reliable and efficient log management solution. SentinelOne generates logs 
that capture information about endpoint activity, threats, and user behavior.

To manage these logs effectively, organizations can use Filebeat, an open-source 
log shipping tool, to send logs from SentinelOne to various destinations, including 
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch, due to its reliability and ease of use. 
Filebeat is widely used to send logs from SentinelOne to various destinations, 
providing organizations with a centralized platform for collecting, processing, 
and visualizing security-related data.

To send SentinelOne logs to Filebeat, organizations can configure SentinelOne to 
forward logs to a syslog server and then use Filebeat to collect and forward log 
data to Elasticsearch or other destinations. This process involves setting up a 
syslog server to receive the logs, configuring SentinelOne to send logs to the 
syslog server, and configuring Filebeat to collect and forward the logs from 
the syslog server to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

In summary, using Filebeat to send SentinelOne logs to various destinations, 
including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, is a reliable and efficient log 
management solution. By configuring SentinelOne to forward logs to a syslog 
server and using Filebeat to collect and forward the logs to Elasticsearch or 
other destinations, organizations can gain insights into endpoint activity, 
threats, and user behavior and take action to protect their networks against cyber threats.
