<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Beanstalkd metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Collects Beanstalkd server and tubes stats
  [[inputs.beanstalkd]]
    ## Server to collect data from
    server = "localhost:11300"

    ## List of tubes to gather stats about.
    ## If no tubes specified then data gathered for each tube on server reported by list-tubes command
    tubes = ["notifications"]
  ```

### Telegraf Beanstalkd Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of Beanstalkd metrics across a distributed environment, a robust and efficient metrics management 
solution is essential. Telegraf, being an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, fits this role well. It can gather 
Beanstalkd metrics from numerous sources, including operational Beanstalkd instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf's rich set of input plugins allows users to collect diverse metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and more, 
crucial for understanding Beanstalkd performance. Organizations can use Prometheus, a renowned open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, to 
store and analyze these metrics, known for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

To transport Beanstalkd metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus 
format and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This involves setting up Telegraf to collect Beanstalkd 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be performed using Grafana. Grafana, 
a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper dive into the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance trends 
and potential issues within the Beanstalkd system.
