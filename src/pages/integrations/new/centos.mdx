Configure Filebeat to ship logs from Centos Systems to Logstash and Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat items={["RPM"]} />

  ### Enable The System Module

  There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the system module.

  Change directory to the location where filebeat was extracted and run the following commands:

  ```cmd copy
  sudo filebeat modules list
  sudo filebeat modules enable system
  ```

  Navigate to the `modules.d` folder, copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the system.yml module file:

  ```yaml copy
  # Module: system
  # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12.2/filebeat-module-system.html

  - module: system
    # Syslog
    syslog:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:

    # Authorization logs
    auth:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:
  ```
  
  ### Update your configuration file

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of `filebeat.yml` 
  (this file can be found in the folder where you installed Filebeat in the first step).

  <Callout type="info">
    Filebeat modules offer the quickest way to begin working with standard log formats. 
    If you opt to configure Filebeat manually rather than utilizing modules, 
    you'll do so by listing inputs in the filebeat.inputs section of filebeat.yml. 
    These inputs detail how Filebeat discovers and handles input data. 
  </Callout>
      
  ```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  ###################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ==============================
  filebeat.inputs:
  - type: filestream
    enabled: true
    id: my_unique_id
    paths:
      # REQUIRED CHANGE TO YOUR LOGS PATH
      - /var/log/*.log
    fields:
      type: logfile
      
  # ============================== Filebeat modules ==============================
  filebeat.config.modules:
    path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml
    reload.enabled: false
    #reload.period: 10s

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  # ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
    loadbalance: true
    ssl.enabled: true

  # ================================= Processors =================================
  processors:
    - add_host_metadata:
        when.not.contains.tags: forwarded
    - add_cloud_metadata: ~
    - add_docker_metadata: ~
    - add_kubernetes_metadata: ~
  ```

  ### Validate Configuration
    
  ```ps1 copy
  sudo ./filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml --strict.perms=false
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    If the yml file is invalid, filebeat will print an `error loading config file` 
    error message with details on how to correct the problem. If you have issues 
    starting filebeat see "How To Diagnose No Data In Stack" below to troubleshoot.
  </Callout>

  ### Start filebeat

  To start Filebeat, run:

  ```bash copy
  sudo chown root filebeat.yml 
  ```

  ```bash copy
  sudo chown root modules.d/system.yml
  sudo chown root module/system/syslog/manifest.yml
  sudo chown root module/system/auth/manifest.yml
  sudo ./filebeat -e
  ```

  You'll be running filebeat as root, so you need to __change ownership of the configuration file__ and any 
  configurations enabled in the modules.d directory, or run filebeat with __--strict.perms=false__ as shown above. 

  Read more about how to [change ownership](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/config-file-permissions.html).

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

### CentOS Overview

CentOS is a Linux distribution & computing platform that is often compared 
with [Red Hat](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/redhat) Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 

The main difference between the two is that CentOS lacks the high level of 
technical support that is supplied as part of the RHEL package.  

CentOS is built off of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux's open source code 
base, explaining their commonalities and relative compatibility.

Due to this similarity their library versions are identical. This means that 
binaries that work on RHEL will work on CentOS. If you're using their administration 
tools you might notice incompatibilities between the two distributions as 
minor patches are updated at different rates.Large patches & major releases 
for CentOS are released sporadically & infrequently compared to other Linux 
distributions (such as [Ubuntu](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/ubuntu) 
& [Debian](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/debian)).

CentOS users are typically individuals & businesses that don't require strong levels 
of support, certification & training to use this enterprise class Linux distribution successfully. 

Our built in CentOS [log file analyser](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/log-analysis) is 
included in our [log management platform](https://logit.io/platform/logging/log-management) 
and is built upon the open source tools Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana to ease the processing 
of large amounts of Linux server data for troubleshooting & root cause analysis.

Logit.io can be used to centralise your Linux log 
data & [alerts](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-alerting) on errors 
to monitor your operating system (OS). The platform can also be used 
to [view logs](https://logit.io/solutions/log-viewer) within Kibana for 
detailed visualisations & reporting.
   
If you need any assistance with analysing your CentOS logs we're here to help.
