Configure Telegraf to ship PgBouncer metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ## Metrics
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many pgbouncer servers
  [[inputs.pgbouncer]]
    ## specify address via a url matching:
    ##   postgres://[pqgotest[:password]]@host:port[/dbname]\
    ##       ?sslmode=[disable|verify-ca|verify-full]
    ## or a simple string:
    ##   host=localhost port=5432 user=pqgotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
    ##
    ## All connection parameters are optional.
    ##
    address = "host=localhost user=pgbouncer sslmode=disable"
  ```

### Telegraf PgBouncer Overview

For the effective monitoring and analysis of PgBouncer metrics across a distributed environment, it's crucial to implement 
a robust and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting 
metrics, is well-suited for this role. It can gather PgBouncer metrics from various sources, including operational 
PgBouncer instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf features a wide range of input plugins, allowing users to collect diverse metrics such as CPU usage, memory 
utilization, network traffic, and more. These metrics are vital for understanding PgBouncer performance. 
To store and analyze these collected metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and 
alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and powerful data visualization capabilities.

To transmit PgBouncer metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This involves setting up Telegraf to collect PgBouncer metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring 
Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using 
Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out 
using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability features, 
is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth 
look at the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues in the PgBouncer system.
