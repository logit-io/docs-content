  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Set up an Events Reporting integration

  To get started, sign in to your 1Password account, click Integrations in the sidebar, and choose Elastic.

  Then follow these steps to add an the integration to your 1Password account and create a bearer JSON web token:

  - Enter a name for the integration, then click Add Integration.
  - Enter a name for the bearer token and choose when it will expire. Select the event types the token has access to, then click Issue Token.
  - Click Save in 1Password and choose which vault to save your token to. Then click View Integration Details.
  - You can now use your bearer token to authenticate the 1Password Events API Beat with Elasticsearch.

  You can issue or revoke bearer tokens at any time.

  ### Install 1Password Events API Beat

  Download and install the 1Password Events API Elastic Beat from the [1Password GitHub repository](https://github.com/1Password/events-api-elastic/releases).
  
  The 1Password Events API Beat returns information from 1Password through requests to the Events API and sends that data securely to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash. 
  
  ### Configure 1Password Events API Beat

  In the directory you installed the Beat rename the `eventsapibeat-sample.yml` configuration file to `eventsapibeat.yaml`. 
  
  Below is an example of the configuration file. If you are logged into your Logit.io account this configuration file 
  is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash and is set up to monitor three different types 
  of events from 1Password: 
  `signin attempts`, `item usages`, and `audit events`. 
  
  Add your 1Password bearer token to the auth_token fields for each event type you want to monitor and 
  update the `starting_cursor` limit and date / time as appropriate.

```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
###################### Logit.io eventsapibeat Configuration ########################

  ### Run 1Password Events API Beat
  
  Run the following command in the directory where you installed the 1Password Events API Beat to start the Beat and begin monitoring events from your 1Password account:

  ```sh
  ./eventsapibeat -c eventsapibeat.yml -e
  ```
  You can now monitor events from your 1Password account in your Logit.io Stack. The returned data will follow the Elastic Common Schema specifications.
