      There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the logstash module:

      ```ps1 copy
      .\filebeat.exe modules list
      .\filebeat.exe modules enable logstash
      ```

      In the module config under modules.d, change the module settings to match your environment. You must enable at least one fileset in the module. 
      
      ___Filesets are disabled by default___.

      Copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the logstash.yml module file:

      ```yaml copy
      # Module: logstash
      # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12/filebeat-module-logstash.html

      - module: logstash
        # logs
        log:
          enabled: true

          # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
          # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
          # var.paths:

        # Slow logs
        slowlog:
          enabled: true
          # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,

### Logstash Overview

__What Is Logstash?__
  
Logstash is an open-source light-weight processing pipeline created by Elastic. 
It is the most popular data pipeline used for Elasticsearch 
as their close integration allows for powerful log processing capabilities.     

__What is Logstash Used For?__

Logstash makes up an essential part of the ELK Stack as it provides the easiest solution for collecting, parsing, and storing logs for 
analysis & monitoring.      

Logstash's wide range of over 200 open-source plugins help you easily index your data across multiple log types including error, event & web 
server files from hundreds of popular integrations. The tool offers an array of input, output, & filter plugins for enriching, and transforming 
data from a variety of sources including [Golang](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/golang), 
[Google Cloud](/integrations/log-management/google-cloud/operations), & [Azure](/integrations/log-management/azure/azure).

__What Are The Advantages Of Using Logstash?__

Some of the advantages of using this pipeline include high availability & flexibility, due to the wide adoption of ELK & the large community 
supporting their regularly maintained plugins. Some of the most popular plugins include Logtrailing (for tailing live events), Beats 
(including [Metricbeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/metricbeat) & [Heartbeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/heartbeat)), & 
[TCP](/integrations/log-management/protocols/tcp).

Logstash also benefits from having a straightforward configuration format that reduces the complexity of getting started with ELK. Data 
ingestion using Logstash is enriched prior to being indexed by Elasticsearch, making it readily available for filtering, analysis & reporting 
in Kibana once data is migrated to your ELK Stack
