Configure Filebeat to ship Cisco logs to Logstash and Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Configure Cisco Router
  Enable your Cisco ASA router to send logs to a remote server over TCP. 
  As this isn't enabled by default you will need to enable it, you can follow the instructions here to do so.

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Update your configuration file

      The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.

      __Note__: Please make sure the ___'paths'___ field in the Filebeat inputs section and the ___'hosts'___ field in the Logstash outputs section are correctly populated.
      If you are logged into your Logit.io account the ___'hosts'___ field should have been pre-populated with the correct values. 
      The ___'paths'___ field will need to be set to the location of the logs you want to send to your Stack e.g. ```- /Windows/DtcInstall.log``` is a log file called DtcInstall.log located in C:/Windows.
      
      Copy the configuration file below (making the above changes as necessary) and overwrite the contents of __filebeat.yml__ (this file can be found in the location where you installed Filebeat in the previous step. If it is missing create a new file with that name and populate it with the configuration details below).

### Cisco Meraki Logging Overview

Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is a network security device that provides firewall, VPN, and other security services for enterprise networks. ASA devices are typically deployed at the edge of the network to protect it from external threats and to control access to internal resources.
      
ASA devices generate a variety of logs that record various events and activities on the network. These logs are used to monitor network security, troubleshoot issues, and identify security threats. 

Here are some common types of logs generated by ASA devices:

_System Logs_: These logs record system-level events such as device startup, shutdown, and configuration changes.

_Connection Logs_: These logs record details about network connections such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

_Access Logs_: These logs record information about access attempts to the network, including login attempts and access requests.

_Threat Logs_: These logs record security-related events such as intrusion attempts, malware detections, and security policy violations.

_VPN Logs_: These logs record details about VPN connections such as user authentication, encryption, and tunneling.

ASA devices provide real-time visibility into network activity through the ASA dashboard, which can be used to search and filter logs based on various criteria such as time range, device, event type, and severity. The logs can also be exported for further analysis or integration with third-party tools. ASA devices can also be integrated with Cisco Security Manager (CSM) to provide centralized management and reporting for multiple ASA devices.
