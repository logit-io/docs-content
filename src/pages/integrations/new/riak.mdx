Configure Telegraf to ship Riak metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ## Metrics
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics one or many Riak servers
  [[inputs.riak]]
    # Specify a list of one or more riak http servers
    servers = ["http://localhost:8098"]
  ```

### Telegraf Riak Overview

To efficiently monitor and analyze Riak metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential to 
implement a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics 
collection agent, is an excellent tool for this purpose, able to gather Riak metrics from a variety 
of sources, including active Riak nodes, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf boasts an extensive assortment of input plugins, allowing users to collect metrics from 
diverse sources such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and more. For storing and 
interrogating these gathered metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting system renowned for its flexible querying language and robust graphical data visualization features.

To ship Riak metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then arrange for Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Riak metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to pull these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually analyzing the data 
using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics are successfully transferred into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
conducted using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform celebrated for its monitoring and observability 
capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive 
dashboards for a deeper understanding of the metrics data, providing a comprehensive view of performance trends and potential issues.
