Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor Azure Kubernetes 
Service by collecting logs from the containers running on the host system. 
Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and 
ship Azure Kubernetes logs to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Download Filebeat Manifest File

  Download the filebeat kubernetes deployment manifest using the link below:

  [Click to download filebeat-kubernetes.yaml](https://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml)

  To do this on your Azure Cluster you can use the following command in the Azure Cloud Shell terminal. 

  ```cmd copy
  wget https://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ``` 

  ### Insert stack details

  <InsertStackDetails>

  Now you have the manifest you're going to want to add your Stack details. Open the file in a text editor.

  Locate the environment variables controlling the logging destination and enter your Stacks Logstash input information. 

  You need to change the environment variables around lines 54.
  </InsertStackDetails>

  ### Deploy Filebeat pod

  Now your Filebeat deployment manifest is updated with your Stack details, you can deploy it using the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:
          
  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

  ### Confirm deployment succesful

  Confirm that your pod has successfully been deployed using one or all of the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell:

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl get po -A

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/filebeat

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
  ```

  You should see a pod for each Kubernetes node with a name similar to filebeat-abcde listed.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
