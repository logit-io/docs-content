In Microsoft Azure the Activity Log is a platform that provides insights into 
subscription level events, including auditable details of when a resource is modified 
or when a container is started. By configuring the required activity logs to forward 
to Event Hub we can then pull them into the Logit.io ELK Stack via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Ensure Azure Event Hub

  Before you begin you will need to ensure you have an available 
  Azure Event Hub in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

  You should create a diagnostic setting to send 
  the [Activity logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) to this Event Hub.

  Once you have configured your Event Hub we now need to confirm messages are arriving.

  ### Confirm Messages in Event Hub

  In your Azure Portal browse to your Event Hub, from the dashboard you should be able to see messages arriving.

  <Callout type="info">
    Ensure there is recent activity on the graph and the incoming requests isn't zero.
  </Callout>
