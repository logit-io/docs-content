Configure Telegraf to ship RavenDB metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ## Metrics
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Reads metrics from RavenDB servers via the Monitoring Endpoints
  [[inputs.ravendb]]
    ## Node URL and port that RavenDB is listening on. By default,
    ## attempts to connect securely over HTTPS, however, if the user
    ## is running a local unsecure development cluster users can use
    ## HTTP via a URL like "http://localhost:8080"
    url = "https://localhost:4433"

    ## RavenDB X509 client certificate setup
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/raven.crt"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/raven.key"

    ## Optional request timeout
    ##
    ## Timeout, specifies the amount of time to wait
    ## for a server's response headers after fully writing the request and
    ## time limit for requests made by this client
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## List of statistics which are collected
    # At least one is required
    # Allowed values: server, databases, indexes, collections
    #
    # stats_include = ["server", "databases", "indexes", "collections"]

    ## List of db where database stats are collected
    ## If empty, all db are concerned
    # db_stats_dbs = []

    ## List of db where index status are collected
    ## If empty, all indexes from all db are concerned
    # index_stats_dbs = []

    ## List of db where collection status are collected
    ## If empty, all collections from all db are concerned
    # collection_stats_dbs = []
  ```

### Telegraf RavenDB metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze RavenDB metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential to have a 
reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, 
is ideally suited for gathering RavenDB metrics from diverse sources, including operational RavenDB 
instances, databases, and other related applications.

Telegraf offers a wide range of input plugins, allowing users to gather metrics from different sources 
such as CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and more. To store and query these collected metrics, 
organizations can make use of Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting system that supports 
a flexible querying language and graphical visualization of data.

To ship RavenDB metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output 
metrics in the Prometheus format, and then use Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect metrics from RavenDB and output them in the Prometheus 
format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve the metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visualizing and 
analyzing the data using Prometheus's flexible querying and graphical visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics have been imported into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out 
using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability that is perfectly 
compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide 
a more detailed look into the metrics data.
