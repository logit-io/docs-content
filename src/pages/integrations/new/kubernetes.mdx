Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that enables you to send your Kubernetes 
logs to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined 
examples below to start sending and analysing your Kubernetes logs.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Copy Manifest File

  <CopyManifestFile />

  ### Deploy Pod

  Now your deployment manifest is updated, you can deploy it using.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

  ### Confirm Completed Deployment

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/filebeat

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
  ```
  You should see a pod for each kubernetes node with a name similar to filebeat-abcde listed.
  The pods should work though from Pending to Running within a couple of minutes as the containers are downloaded and started.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

### Kubernetes Logging to OpenSearch Overview

Kubernetes was open-sourced in 2014 by Google and has quickly become one of the most popular container management tools on the 
market as it helps to significantly lower the cost of cloud computing & provides a resilient framework for deploying applications.

A common challenge for effective Kubernetes log aggregation is that during spikes data can easily be lost and not accounted for 
without a scalable logging solution such as Logit.io. Our platform also provides log tailing for real-time monitoring of your Kubernetes metrics. 

Logit.io's [container monitoring](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/container-monitoring/) platform is built to collect, parse, and transform 
[application logs](https://logit.io/platform/logging/logging-as-a-service/application-logging/) from your Kubernetes clusters within a few steps 
using the power of the managed Elastic Stack. 

Monitor across 1,000s of containers, layers, logs levels, and data types, in one 
[centralised logging platform](https://logit.io/platform/logging/logging-as-a-service/centralised-logging/) & save hours on monthly maintenance 
to support the ELK Stack.

If you need any further help with migrating your Kubernetes log files using Filebeat we're here to help. Feel free to reach
