  ### Configure GitLab Logging

  GitLab comes equipped with a sophisticated logging framework that ships several system logs. 
          
  To manage these logs effectively, we recommend referring to 
  the ["Log system from GitLab"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs/index.html) documentation 
  and customizing the Filebeat configuration below to meet your specific requirements. 
  
  This will help you collect and forward the relevant log data to your 
  preferred destination for analysis and monitoring purposes.

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.
        
Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat 
configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration #########################
# ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================

## GitLab Overview

GitLab is a versatile software development platform that offers numerous features to 
streamline development workflows for organizations. To effectively monitor and analyze 
activity on GitLab, it's crucial to have a reliable and efficient log management solution.

GitLab generates various types of logs that capture significant information about system 
activity, application performance, and user behavior. Organizations can use Filebeat, 
an open-source log shipper, to send GitLab logs to various destinations such as 
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch for effective log management.

Filebeat is highly compatible and easy to use, making it a widely preferred option for 
sending logs from GitLab to different destinations. Organizations can configure GitLab 
to forward logs to a syslog server and use Filebeat to collect and 
forward log data to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

A robust log management solution enables organizations to gain valuable insights into 
GitLab activity and take proactive steps to ensure optimal system performance and 
application security. By leveraging tools such as Filebeat and OpenSearch, organizations 
can analyze data from various sources and gain a deeper understanding of their development workflows.
