  ### Configure bunny.net Logging

  __Configure the bunny.net content delivery network to log to a syslog server:__

  To select logs from a Pull Zone on bunny.net, log in to your account 
  and navigate to the details page of the Pull Zone
  
  On the left side panel, click on "Security" and select "Logging", ensure that 
  both "Enable logging" and "Enable log forwarding" switches are turned on
  
  Under the "Syslog Endpoint" section enter the following:
  
  - Hostname: FILEBEAT-IP-ADDRESS
  - Port: 514
  - Log Server Protocol: UDP
  - Log Format: Plain Text

  Save the Forwarding Configuration.

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.
        
Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat 
configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################

## bunny.net Overview

Bunny.net is a powerful content delivery network that provides fast and reliable 
content delivery for websites, videos, and other online content. To effectively 
monitor and analyze the performance of your Bunny.net CDN, it is essential to 
have a reliable and efficient log management solution. The Bunny.net CDN generates 
logs that capture information about network traffic, user activity, and content delivery.

To manage these logs effectively, organizations can use Filebeat, an open-source 
shipping tool, to send logs from the Bunny.net CDN to various destinations, including 
OpenSearch, Logstash, and Kibana, due to its reliability and minimal memory footprint. 
Filebeat is widely used to send logs from Bunny.net CDN to various destinations, 
including OpenSearch, Logstash, and Kibana, due to its compatibility and ease of use.

To send Bunny.net CDN logs to Filebeat, organizations can configure the CDN to forward 
logs to a syslog server, and then use Filebeat to collect and forward log data to 
OpenSearch or other destinations. This process involves setting up a syslog server to 
receive the logs, configuring the CDN to send logs to the syslog server, and configuring 
Filebeat to collect and forward the logs from the syslog server to OpenSearch or other destinations.

In summary, using Filebeat to send Bunny.net CDN logs to various destinations, including 
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, is a reliable and efficient log management solution. 
By configuring the CDN to forward logs to a syslog server and using Filebeat to collect and 
forward the logs to Logit.io, organizations can gain insights into network traffic, user activity, 
and content delivery, and take action to improve the performance and reliability of their Bunny.net CDN.
