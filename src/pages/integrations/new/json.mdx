Send JSON logs to Logit.io via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Send a single JSON log using curl

  ```cmd copy
  curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: default" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d '{"test":"This is a test", "Country":"United Kingdom", "Weather":"Sunny" }'
  ```

  When you are logged in to your Logit.io account your ApiKey should be populated automatically.

  Executing the command above will send the string through to Logstash. This can now be viewed by opening Kibana.

  If the receiving stack has been set up to parse JSON, the data will have been logged as three new values. 
  If the stack has not been set up to parse JSON the message 
  field will contain a string corresponding with the data that has been sent.

  Section 3 of this document has an example of how to update a filter to parse JSON data.

  ### Send JSON log files using curl

  It is also possible to test sending a JSON file to Logstash for logging. This example will show how to do this. 

  Let's have a look at the contents of our sample.json file.

  ```json copy
  {
    "name": "Jason",
    "city": "Manchester",
    "display": "Hello there from JSON file",
    "value": 5
  }
  ```

  The following command should now be entered into the command prompt, this will send the file to Logstash:

  ```cmd copy
  curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: json" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d @sample.json
  ```

  You should be able to see the new log record in Kibana. If the receiving stack has been set up to parse JSON, the data will have been logged a
  s four new values. If the stack has not been set up to parse JSON the message field will contain a string corresponding with the data that has been sent.
