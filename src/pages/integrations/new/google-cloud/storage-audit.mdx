<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Export Logs to Google Pub/Sub

  Ensure that you have Cloud Storage Audit Logs configured in [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs).

  Now we can filter the logs as needed, by clicking on the service name and choosing Show matching entries as shown below.

  <Callout type="info">
    Read more about how to configure and export logs using the [Google Operations Console](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/storage/docs/audit-logs)
  </Callout>

  ### Create A Sink

  To export the logs choose Create sink as shown below.

  ![Select sink service](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss2.png)
  You will be then be prompted for:
  - Sink details (enter a name)
  - Sink destination (choose Cloud Pub/Sub topic creating a new topic if needed)
  - Choose logs to include in sink (this will have a filter applied already if you filtered the logs above)

  Choose Create sink to continue.

  ### Create Google Pub/Sub

  Locate your newly created [Pub/Sub topic](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/) and choose Create subscription.

  ![Find topic in Topics menu](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss5.png)
  
  Enter a suitable Subscription ID and leave the delivery type as pull.

  We don't need to change anything further at this stage, scroll to the bottom and choose CREATE to create the Subscription.

  ### Create Service Account

  Now in [service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), choose the project you're working with. 
      
  Then select CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT, this account will be used to retrieve logs from the Pub/Sub and send them to Logit.io.

  ![Service accounts screenshot](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss8.png)

  Name the service account and in step 2 add the role Pub/Sub Subscriber as shown below, then choose DONE.
  
  ![View new service account](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss11.png)

  Now choose Manage keys as shown below.

  ![Add key using dropdown](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss12.png)

  Then choose ADD KEY > Create new key, choosing the recommended JSON format. This will download the JSON key to your machine ready to use in the next step.

  ### Configuring Logstash

  To start pulling logs and metrics from the Google Cloud Platform to your Stack you need to configure a Google Cloud Platform Input on your Logit.io Stack.

  <ConfigurePubSub type="" utmSource="Google_Cloud_Storage_Audit" utmMedium="google" utmCampaign="googlecloudstorage"/>

  <Callout type="info">
    Logit.io will verify your input before it is applied, we will contact you to confirm when this has been completed.
  </Callout>

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="google" utmCampaign="googlecloudstorage" source="Google_Cloud_Storage_Audit" />
</Steps>

## Cloud Storage Logging Overview

Effectively analyzing data is a crucial aspect of maintaining the performance 
and security of your applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
If you're looking to centralize and gain insights from your log data stored 
in Google Cloud Storage, integrating it with Logit.io can be a game-changer.

Logit.io offers a robust log management and analysis platform that can help you 
extract valuable insights from your log data. Explore the extensive range of 
services and tools that GCP offers via our source integrations to make the
