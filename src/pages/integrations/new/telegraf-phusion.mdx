Configure Telegraf to ship Phusion Passenger metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics of passenger using passenger-status
  [[inputs.passenger]]
    ## Path of passenger-status.
    ##
    ## Plugin gather metric via parsing XML output of passenger-status
    ## More information about the tool:
    ##   https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/admin/apache/overall_status_report.html
    ##
    ## If no path is specified, then the plugin simply execute passenger-status
    ## hopefully it can be found in your PATH
    command = "passenger-status -v --show=xml"
  ```

### Telegraf Phusion Passenger Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of Phusion metrics in a distributed environment, a solid and efficient 
metrics management solution is crucial. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting 
metrics, is ideally suited for this role. It can gather Phusion metrics from a multitude of sources, 
including operational Phusion instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf offers a wide range of input plugins, enabling users to collect various metrics such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more. These are all key for understanding Phusion performance. 
To store and scrutinize these harvested metrics, organizations can employ Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting toolkit renowned for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

Transmitting Phusion metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves configuring Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Phusion metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting 
the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
conducted using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability 
capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to create dynamic, interactive 
dashboards for a deep dive into the metrics data, offering a comprehensive understanding of 
performance trends and potential issues within the Phusion system.
