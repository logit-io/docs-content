Follow our Heroku tutorial to get started sending Heroku logs to Logstash for monitoring and analysis.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Setup

  By setting up a log drain on your Heroku app, you can send all of your app's generated logs, 
  as well as all Heroku platform logs (including those generated from the build and deployment process), to Logstash.

  All you need to do is add this endpoint as a drain in your Heroku app 
  using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install):
  
  ```cmd copy
  heroku drains:add https://@logitApiEndpoint/heroku?apikey=@apikey -a appname
  ```
  
  Make sure to replace `appname` with the name of your app you previously 
  created on your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), or via the CLI.

  We automatically parse the logs into a structured format for you, so all you need to do is analyse them.

## Heroku Logging Overview

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) owned by Salesforce. Heroku supports 
applications built in Java, [Python](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/python), 
and [Golang](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/golang) as 
well as a variety of other popular programming languages. Heroku can be used by developers to build, 
run and scale applications making it a widely used and popular cloud-based platform.

The Heroku app's various logs levels including; App logs, System logs, API logs & Add-on logs. 
App logs are generated when your application throws an exception, e.gsuch as when a 
missing dependency is discovered. System logs, on the other hand, will allow you to 
see when an application is restarted due to issues with your infrastructure.

Being able to tail both application and system logs in Heroku will allow you to see 
issues as they occur in real-time within your production environment. Monitoring 
these will help enable your teams to make changes fast to preserve the health of 
your infrastructure and resolve errors found in production.

The Logit.io platform allows you to tail Heroku logs with ease using our highly 
available enterprise-grade ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana) Stack for fast 
troubleshooting & analysis. Our platform also provides a comprehensive solution 
for centralising your log streams & outputs from many other applications 
including [Docker](/integrations/log-management/containerisation/docker), [Kubernetes](/integrations/log-management/containerisation/kubernetes) and 
Amazon Flow Logs](/integrations/log-management/aws/vpc).
