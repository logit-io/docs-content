## OpenVPN Overview

OpenVPN is a well-known open-source VPN solution that offers secure and encrypted 
connectivity for remote sites and users. To effectively monitor and analyze OpenVPN 
activity, it is crucial to have a dependable and efficient log management solution.

OpenVPN generates logs that record important information about system activity, 
connection attempts, and client behavior. To efficiently manage these logs, 
organizations can utilize Filebeat, which is an open-source log shipper, to 
send OpenVPN logs to various destinations such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, or OpenSearch.

Filebeat is widely used because of its compatibility and ease of use for sending 
logs from OpenVPN to different destinations. To ship OpenVPN logs to Filebeat, 
organizations can configure OpenVPN to write logs to a specific location, and 
then Filebeat can collect and forward the log data to other destinations like OpenSearch.

Having a robust log management solution in place enables organizations to gain 
valuable insights into OpenVPN activity and take proactive steps to ensure 
optimal system performance and security. By utilizing tools like the Elastic 
Stack and Filebeat, organizations can analyze data from various sources and 
have a better understanding of VPN connectivity and user behavior.
