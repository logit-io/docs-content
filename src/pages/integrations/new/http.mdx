  - Valid JSON content
  - API key, sent in the headers. If you are logged into your Logit.io account the API key and endpoint should be automatically populated in the examples below.
  - Content-Type header set as application/json
  - Either POST or PUT to https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2

  ### Example

  CMD
  ```bash copy
  curl -i -H "ApiKey: @apikey" -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "LogType: json" https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2 -d "{\"test\":\"test\",\"example\": { \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 } }"
  ```

  Powershell
  ```ps1 copy
  curl -Method Post `
  -Uri "https://@logitApiEndpoint/v2" `
  -Headers @{
      "ApiKey" = "@apikey";
      "Content-Type" = "application/json";
      "LogType" = "json"
  } `

      example = @{
          a = 1;
          b = 2
      }
  } | ConvertTo-Json)
  ```
