Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that enables you to send your OKE logs to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined 
examples below to start sending and analysing your OKE logs.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Download Manifest

  Download the filebeat Oracle Kubernetes Engine deploy manifest using the link below:

  [Click to download filebeat-kubernetes-oke.yaml](http://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes-oke.yaml)

  ### Insert stack details

  <InsertStackDetails>
      Open the manifest and around line 57 you should see the environment variables controlling the logging destination. You need to update them to point 
      to your stack.
  </InsertStackDetails>

  ### Deploy Pod

  Now your deployment manifest is updated, you can deploy it using.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f filebeat-kubernetes-oke.yaml
  ```

  ### Confirm Completed Deployment

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/filebeat

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
  ```

  You should see a pod for each kubernetes node with a name similar to filebeat-abcde listed.
  The pods should work though from Pending to Running within a couple of minutes as the containers are downloaded and started.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
