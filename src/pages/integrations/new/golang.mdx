  ## Logs

  Configure your GoLang application to send logs to Logstash & Elasticsearch.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Create Go Logging Application

  Paste the following into a Go file to create a generic logging application.
      
  This is not a straight plug and play piece of code. You will need to add this 
  to your own application and tell it when to log Info, Warn, Error & Fatal messages 
  in order for this to work. This is just an example configuration to get you started.
  
  ```go copy showLineNumbers
  package main
  import (
          "github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook"
          "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
          "crypto/tls"
  )
  func main() {
          log := logrus.New()
          conn, err := tls.Dial("tcp", "@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort", &tls.Config{ RootCAs: nil }) 
          if err != nil {
                  log.Fatal(err)
          }
          hook := logrustash.New(conn, logrustash.DefaultFormatter(logrus.Fields{"type": "myappName"}))
          log.Hooks.Add(hook)
          ctx := log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
                  "method": "main",
          })
          ctx.Info("Info Message")
          ctx.Error("Error Message")
          ctx.Warn("Warn Message")
          ctx.Fatal("Fatal Message")
  }
  ```
  
  In the code above you can edit the message displayed by editing the text 
  between the brackets of the ctx.Info, ctx.Error etc.

  ### Go Package Requirements

  Now you need to run the following commands to install the logging package requirements

  ```cmd copy
  go get github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook
  go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus
  ```

  ### Run the application
  
  If you called the example configuration file logs.go you would run the following command 
  and then be able to see the Info, Warn, Error & Fatal message in Kibana.
      
  ```cmd copy
  go run logs.go
  ```
  
  You should see output similar to the following:

  ```ruby copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "@timestamp" => "2020-04-07T22:22:43.000Z",
    "@version" => "1",
    "level" => "info",
    "message" => "Info Message",
    "method" => "main",
    "host" => "172.17.0.1",
    "port" => 15678,
    "type" => "myappName"
  }
  ```

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

## Golang Logging Overview

Golang (also known as Go) is an open-source programming language created in 2009 by Google. 
It forms the backbone of many platforms, including the core tools involved in 
containerisation ([Kubernetes](/integrations/log-management/containerisation/kubernetes) & [Docker](/integrations/log-management/containerisation/docker)).

While many [application logs](https://logit.io/platform/logging/logging-as-a-service/application-logging/) 
include a variety of statuses, Golang only records log messages when an error is generated. 
Golang error logs include a variety of valuable data for troubleshooting, including 
timestamps, contextual data, and what level of error has been encountered. 
      
It may not be sustainable for large organisations to track these log messages reliably 
if your Go logs are deployed across numerous hosts. These will likely require 
tailing in a centralised logging environment.

Using a specialised Golang logger makes root cause analysis, application monitoring, 
and reporting at scale far easier than relying on distributed logs located 
across all your Go-based applications.  
      
The Logit.io platform includes everything you need for Golang logging & is built to 
enable you to drive data-driven insights for error resolution fast. Our platform is 
fully integrated with a number of third-party alerting tools so you can be notified 
in real-time when your program encounters an exception.
