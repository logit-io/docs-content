Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Send HTTP/S logs to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.Learn how configure 
  Syslog to securely ship logs over SSL to your Stack via Logstash. This is 
  a good choice when you need to ship logs from appliances or devices 
  where you cannot run one of the [beats shippers](/integrations/).
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Download the Logit.io SSL Certificate

  Download root.logit.io.crt file and place in /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d/ or another directory
          
  [https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt](https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt)

  ```bash copy
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d
  sudo curl -o /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    rsyslog trusts these root CA keys to validate the key presented by Logit.io, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
  </Callout>

  ### RSyslog

  ```yaml copy /"@logstash.host:strip_quotes"/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  $DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt
  $ModLoad lmnsd_gtls
  $ActionSendStreamDriver gtls
  $ActionSendStreamDriverMode 1
  $ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode x509/name
  $ActionSendStreamDriverPermittedPeer *.logit.io

  *.* @@"@logstash.host:strip_quotes":@logstash.sslPort
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    * On many distros, also install the rsyslog-gnutls package (including CentOS, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu)
    * If possible run the latest minor versions of rsyslog v7 or v8. There are many TLS bugs in past versions.
    * Ensure you have @@ not a single @ infront of the host. This is so TCP is used.
  </Callout>

  ### Restart rsyslog so it detects the TLS-over-TCP destination:

  ```bash copy
  sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
  ```

  ### Troubleshooting

  If you see either

  ```cmd copy
  could not load module '/usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so',
  rsyslog error -2078 [try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2068 ]
  ```

  Or

  ``` cmd copy
  could not load module '/usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so', 
  dlopen: /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2066 ]
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    First, make sure that module actually exists by running ls against the path in the error, such as:
  </Callout>

  ```bash copy
  ls -la /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so
  ```

  If it doesn't exist, install the related package (often called rsyslog-gnutls) or if you compiled rsyslog from source, compile the module.

  ```bash copy
  sudo apt-get install rsyslog-gnutls
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    Second, ensure that the user which runs _rsyslog_ has permissions to read Logit.io's public key. 
    On many distributions, _rsyslog_ starts as root and then drops to a user. In that case, in order to let all users read the key file, run the following command
  </Callout>

  ```bash copy
  chmod 644 /etc/rsyslog.d/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    Finally confirm how you are loading the TLS Module:
  </Callout>

  If you are using ```$ModLoad lmnsd_gtls``` to explicitly load the TLS module, and that configuration option occurs before the ```$DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile``` has been 
  defined. Explicitly loading the module is rarely required and the configuration above does not use it. 

  We recommend removing that ```$ModLoad lmnsd_gtls``` option and relying on autoloading. If your ```lmnsd_gtls``` needs to be explicitly loaded, like because it is in a 
  non-default location, move the ```$DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile``` config line above the ```$ModLoad``` line.

  ### Launch OpenSearch Dashboards to View Your Data

  ### Syslog dashboard

  The Syslog module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### Syslog Logging Overview

Syslog is a format of message logs commonly used across many operating systems & network devices to send data to a logging server. Event data 
recorded by the system logging protocol can then be accessed by IT teams for the purposes of [auditing](https://logit.io/solutions/compliance-and-auditing), 
diagnostics & improving operational efficiency.

Because Syslog is so often used across a variety of devices and systems, there is little standardization. This means that log data gathered by 
events being triggered may be hard to manage and understand quickly enough for swift implementation, especially in fast-growing businesses 
generating data faster than they can [scale](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-autoscaling) for.

Our Syslog log analyser allows you to conduct analysis of hundreds of GBs of Syslog log data fast, allowing you to identify the root cause of 
performance issues and prevent instances of downtime across your [infrastructure](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/infrastructure-monitoring).
