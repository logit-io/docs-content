### Azure Metrics Monitoring Overview

As one of the most popular cloud computing platforms, Microsoft Azure provides businesses with the capabilities to run databases, 
servers & many other services virtually.

Azure Event Hub is a flexible resource that allows you to capture various Azure Monitoring and platform Metrics so you always have 
visibility of the informaton you need. 

As a disaster recovery tool, Azure is known for its advanced site recovery which is operational across all operating systems, 
locations, & languages. The platform also allows users to customise the frequency of backup schedules & works alongside the Logit.io 
platform as our hosted ELK Stacks support version control & rollbacks for added peace of mind.

Our platform is built to enable you to easily store and analyse Azure Metrics data and our hosted Elastic Stack allows you to aggregate 
and analyze all of these Metrics centrally, saving your InfoSec & DevOps teams from unnecessary maintenance overheads by centralising 
all of your Azure platform Metrics.

If you need any further assistance with migrating your Azure Metrics to Logstash we're here to help you discover the insights locked 
in data hosted on Azure, [GCP](/integrations/log-management/google-cloud/operations), AWS or any of the integrations covered in our 
[data sources](/integrations). Feel free to reach out by contacting our 
support team <IntercomButton text="via live chat" /> and we'll be happy to assist.
