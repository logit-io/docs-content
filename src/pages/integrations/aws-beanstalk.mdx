  ## Logs

  Filebeat is an open source shipping agent that lets you ship logs from AWS Beanstalk to one or more destinations, including Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  ### AWS Beanstalk

  To efficiently transport logs to your stack, Filebeat stands out as a streamlined choice. A member of Elastic's Beats family, Filebeat 
  excels at collecting diverse metrics and logs across environments. Its lightweight nature, encryption capabilities, and user-friendly 
  configuration make it an optimal solution.

  Specifically, if you're keen on applying filters to logs, Filebeat offers a straightforward approach. Installation involves minimal effort, 
  and the tool efficiently trails specified files. This is particularly advantageous in an AWS Beanstalk environment, where various log files 
  are generated. Opting for Filebeat ensures a smooth log shipping process and facilitates easy differentiation between log types in OpenSearch.

  ### Installing Filebeat via an .ebextension

  Rather than engaging in manual SSH access to your EC2 instance for Filebeat installation, Elastic Beanstalk streamlines the process by enabling 
  automatic deployment of AWS services and additional software through its extension system, known as .ebextension.

  To implement this, include a .ebextensions folder in the root directory of your application and add a filebeat.config file in YAML format.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of your 
        
  ```yaml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  files:
    "/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml":
      mode: "000755"
      owner: root
      group: root
      content: |
        filebeat.inputs:
        - input_type: filestream
          enabled: true
          paths:
          # REQUIRED: Change the path to your logs
          - /var/log/*.log
          fields:
            type: logfile
        output.logstash:
          hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
          loadbalance: true
          ssl.enabled: true

  commands:
    1_command:
      command: "curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-8.11.3-x86_64.rpm"
      cwd: /home/ec2-user
    2_command:
      command: "rpm -ivh --replacepkgs filebeat-8.11.3-x86_64.rpm"
      cwd: /home/ec2-user
    3_command:
      command: "/etc/init.d/filebeat start"
  ```

  __Validate your YAML__

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if 
  your YAML file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

### AWS Beanstalk Logging Overview

AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment and management in the AWS Cloud. As a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution, 
it frees developers from infrastructure complexities, enabling a focus on code creation.

Deployment is effortless, with Elastic Beanstalk handling resource provisioning, capacity management, and automatic scaling based on demand. 
Supporting diverse programming languages, it offers flexibility for various development needs.

Managed environments cover web servers, application servers, and databases, making Elastic Beanstalk suitable for hosting a variety of applications. 
Seamlessly integrated with other AWS services, it interfaces with Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, and CloudWatch for comprehensive functionality.

Automatic updates ensure a secure and up-to-date environment, and customization options allow users to modify configurations and integrate with 
existing AWS resources. Multi-tier application management is simplified, supporting separate environments for distinct tiers.

Built-in monitoring tools provide insights into application performance, and auto-scaling adjusts instances based on load. In a DevOps-friendly 
environment, Elastic Beanstalk supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), streamlining the software delivery pipeline.
