Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your Apache ZooKeeper 
servers by collecting metrics running on the Apache ZooKeeper server. Configure 
Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Apache ZooKeeper 
logs & service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. 
  To enable the Apache ZooKeeper module, run the following:

  ```cmd copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable zookeeper
  ```

  ### Configure Module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. 
  Locate the configuration file for the Apache ZooKeeper module:
        
  ```txt copy
  `/etc/metricbeat/modules.d/zookeeper.yml`
  ```
        
  By default the following metricsets are disabled. 
  To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.
        
  ```yml copy
  - module: zookeeper
    # metricsets:
      # - mntr
      # - server
    period: 10s
    hosts: ["localhost:2181"]
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your metrics

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="metrics" utmCampaign="uwsgi_metricbeat" source="metrics_zookeeper" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The Apache ZooKeeper metricsets were tested with Apache ZooKeeper `3.4.8` and are expected to 
  work with all versions >= `3.4.0`. Versions prior to `3.4` do not support the `mntr` command.
