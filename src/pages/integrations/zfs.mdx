Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship ZFS metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics of ZFS from arcstats, zfetchstats, vdev_cache_stats, pools and datasets
  # This plugin ONLY supports Linux & FreeBSD
  [[inputs.zfs]]
    ## ZFS kstat path. Ignored on FreeBSD
    ## If not specified, then default is:
    # kstatPath = "/proc/spl/kstat/zfs"

    ## By default, telegraf gather all zfs stats
    ## Override the stats list using the kstatMetrics array:
    ## For FreeBSD, the default is:
    # kstatMetrics = ["arcstats", "zfetchstats", "vdev_cache_stats"]
    ## For Linux, the default is:
    # kstatMetrics = ["abdstats", "arcstats", "dnodestats", "dbufcachestats",
    #     "dmu_tx", "fm", "vdev_mirror_stats", "zfetchstats", "zil"]

    ## By default, don't gather zpool stats
    # poolMetrics = false

    ## By default, don't gather dataset stats
    # datasetMetrics = false
  ```

### Telegraf ZFS Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze ZFS metrics across a distributed environment, 
it's essential to employ a comprehensive and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, 
an open-source server agent for collecting and sending telemetry data, fits this requirement 
perfectly, able to gather ZFS metrics from a variety of sources including operational ZFS 
instances, databases, and other associated applications.

Telegraf's extensive selection of input plugins enables users to collect metrics from diverse 
sources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, and more, all of which can be vital 
for understanding ZFS performance. To store and scrutinize these collected metrics, organizations 
can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting tool known for its flexible 
querying language and powerful data visualization capabilities.

To convey ZFS metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations must configure Telegraf to 
output metrics in Prometheus format, then establish Prometheus to scrape these metrics from 
the Telegraf server. This procedure includes setting up Telegraf to gather ZFS metrics, 
outputting them in Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the 
Telegraf server, and subsequently interpreting the data through Prometheus's robust querying 
and visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization 
can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, an open-source software recognized for its monitoring 
and observability capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It empowers users to design 
dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper exploration of metrics data, delivering a 
comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential bottlenecks in the ZFS system.
