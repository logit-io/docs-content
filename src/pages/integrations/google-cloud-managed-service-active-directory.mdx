## Telegraf Google Managed Service Active Directory Platform metrics Overview

Integrating Telegraf with Google Managed Service for Microsoft AD allows IT administrators 
and DevOps teams to efficiently monitor the health, performance, and security of their AD 
infrastructure on Google Cloud. This is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, 
ensuring system security, and complying with various regulatory standards. By leveraging 
Telegraf for data collection, organizations can gain insights into AD operation metrics, 
such as authentication requests, directory sync times, and system health indicators, 
facilitating proactive management and troubleshooting.
