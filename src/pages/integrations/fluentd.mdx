Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

  ## Logs

  Fluentd is an open source data collector which can be used to collect event logs from multiple sources. 
  It filters, buffers and transforms the data before forwarding to one or more destinations, including 
  [Logstash](/integrations/log-management/shippers/logstash).
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install the output plugin

  <Callout type="info">
      Our fluentd output plugin is available as a gem on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/fluent-plugin-logit).
  </Callout>

  ```bash copy
  gem install fluent-plugin-logit
  ```
  
  ### Configure the output plugin

  Add the following to your fluentd configuration.

  ```cmd copy
  <match>
      @type logit
      stack_id @logs_id
      port @logstash.sslPort      
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /tmp/
      flush_interval 2s
  </match>
  ```

  Ensure the `match` clause is correct for the events you wish to send to Logit.io. Buffering is optional but recommended.

### Fluentd Logging Overview

Fluentd was developed by Treasure Data & initially released in 2011. Fluentd often draws comparisons with Logstash as both log 
collectors share some similarities especially when it comes to platform compatibility.

Where these tools differ though can be seen clearly across their configuration difficulty & performance (Logstash is notably easier 
to configure).

Fluentd on the other hand is known for requiring minimal system resources & can be used with Fluent Bit for an even more lightweight 
method of forwarding your data.

Fluentd is used by many of the world's biggest technology companies, including Atlassian, Microsoft & AWS.

For this configuration guide, we've covered using both Logstash & Fluentd together for forwarding your data for further log 
analysis and processing using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana).

Fluentd is also often used alongside Bigquery as a scalable method of performing queries against log data from Google Cloud. 
A centralised platform for log management can easily prove a more than suitable replacement for this, such as the platform 
we have here at Logit.

The Logit.io platform is built to allow you to drive data-driven insights from your logs & brings together Fluentd & Logstash 
for full observability of your logs in a single centralised platform. Our platform offers a complete solution for centralising 
your log files from multiple applications and servers and provides a Fluentd log analyser as standard.

If you need any more help with migrating your Fluentd to Logstash the Logit.io team are here to help.
