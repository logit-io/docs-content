Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Create IAM Policy
  In the top left corner of your aws console you will notice a services drop down arrow. Open it and from that menu choose IAM.

  ![Select IAM on the left of the menu](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-1.png)

  Now in the left hand menu you want to select policies. Once you have reached the policies page you want to hit the Create Policy that appears towards the top of the page. 

  ![Policies](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-8.png)

  Creating a policy is essentially defining permissions that you can then assign to an identity (user, group or roles.)

  On the create policy screen choose the json tab and enter the following:

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt1444715676000",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
          "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      },
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt1444716576170",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["ec2:DescribeInstances"],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ![Create policies editor](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-3.png)

  At the bottom of the page select review policy and finally on the next page you need to give your policy a name, now hit create policy.

  ### Create IAM User

  You are now going to need to create a new user so that you can attach the policy you 
  created in step one, this will outline the responsibilities of this user. 

  While on the IAM page, in the left hand menu choose users.

  Now at the top of the page select Add User.

  ![Add user](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-2.png)

  Enter a username and make sure to check Programmatic Access, continue onto the next page of creation.

  ![Enter user details](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-5.png)

  In the next section you want to attach an existing policy. Highlight attach exisiting policies and 
  search the policy list below for your newly created policy.

  ![Attach policies](@/images/integrations/aws-cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-6.png)

  Continue onwards to the next step, you can choose to set any Tags here but they aren't necessary. 
  Continue onto the User Review, check all settings are correct and select create user.

  On the next screen you will be given your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. 
  You will need to make a note of these or alternatively download the .csv file provided.

  ### Confirm EC2 Instance (Optional)

  If you already have an EC2 Instance running you can skip this step.

  The easiest way to for the new user to generate some data is to create an EC2 instance so that it can gather the metrics. 
  Select the services drop down and look for EC2, it should come under the heading Compute. 
  On the left hand menu select instances and choose to create a new instance and follow the steps provided.

  Once you've created your instance you can move onto the next step.

  ### Configure Logstash for Amazon EC2

  <AddS3Input type="aws_ec2" utmMedium="metrics" utmCampaign="awsec2" />

  ### Check Logit.io for your metrics

  <LaunchStack source="ec2_metrics" utmMedium="metrics" utmCampaign="awsec2" />

</Steps>

### Amazon EC2 Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from Amazon EC2 instances is a seamless process that enhances 
your log and data management capabilities. Logit.io offers a robust platform for log 
analysis and monitoring, and integrating it with your Amazon EC2 instances can provide 
valuable insights into your application's performance and security. Another crucial element 
of this process is ensuring that your Amazon EC2 instances can efficiently handle incoming 
traffic. [Amazon ELB Application (Elastic Load Balancer)](/integrations/elb-application) 
plays a vital role in distributing traffic across your EC2 instances, the logs of 
this solution can also be ingested into the Logit.io platform. Additionally, for 
long-term storage and data backup, it's essential to consider our integration with 
[Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)](/integrations/s3). Storing your logs and data 
in Amazon S3 provides durability, scalability, and easy access to your historical 
data. By linking to these resources, you can access detailed information on optimizing 
your AWS environment for log analysis and data management. Logit.io's service for 
[AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/) effortlessly incorporates 
these integrations for coordinated operations.
