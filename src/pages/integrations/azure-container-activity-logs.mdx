Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Learn how to ship Azure Container activity logs into the Logit.io ELK Stack via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Ensure Azure Event Hub

  Before you begin you will need to ensure you have an available Azure Event Hub in your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

  We will configure your Container instance to ship activity logs directly to this Azure Event Hub.

  Once you have configured your Event Hub and Event Hub namespace, we need to configure the Container Activity Logs.

  ### Configure Container Activity Logs

  Browse to the Azure Containers on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ContainerInstance%2FcontainerGroups) 
  and select an existing or choose to Add a new container.

  Select the required container and from the left menu and choose Activity Logs. You will see recent Activity logs for the selected container instance.

  ### Configure Activity Log Diagnostic Settings

  In order to direct the Azure Container Activity Logs to our Event Hub we need to configure the diagnostic settings.

  Choose Diagnostic settings from the top menu, then choose Add diagnostic setting. Here we can specify which activity logs we want to stream to the Event Hub.

  ### Confirm Messages in Event Hub

  In your Azure Portal browse to your Event Hub and confirm that messages are arriving. 

  <Callout type="info">
    You should see spikes in the graph and the incoming requests count should not be zero.
  </Callout>
