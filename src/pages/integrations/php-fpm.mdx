Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship PHP-FPM metrics to your Logit.io stack.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy filename="telegraf.conf" showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  # Read metrics of phpfpm, via HTTP status page or socket
  [[inputs.phpfpm]]
    ## An array of addresses to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
    ## with optional port and path
    ##
    ## Plugin can be configured in three modes (either can be used):
    ##   - http: the URL must start with http:// or https://, ie:
    ##       "http://localhost/status"
    ##       "http://192.168.130.1/status?full"
    ##
    ##   - unixsocket: path to fpm socket, ie:
    ##       "/var/run/php5-fpm.sock"
    ##      or using a custom fpm status path:
    ##       "/var/run/php5-fpm.sock:fpm-custom-status-path"
    ##      glob patterns are also supported:
    ##       "/var/run/php*.sock"
    ##
    ##   - fcgi: the URL must start with fcgi:// or cgi://, and port must be present, ie:
    ##       "fcgi://10.0.0.12:9000/status"
    ##       "cgi://10.0.10.12:9001/status"
    ##
    ## Example of multiple gathering from local socket and remote host
    ## urls = ["http://192.168.1.20/status", "/tmp/fpm.sock"]
    urls = ["http://localhost/status"]

    ## Duration allowed to complete HTTP requests.
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  
  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"

### Telegraf PHP-FPM Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of PHP-FPM metrics across a distributed environment, it's crucial to deploy 
a robust and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent designed for collecting 
and sending telemetry data, is perfectly suited for this role. It's capable of gathering PHP-FPM metrics from a 
wide array of sources, such as operational PHP-FPM instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf features a vast selection of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from various sources like 
CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and more. All of these metrics are critical for understanding 
PHP-FPM performance. To store and sift through these harvested metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, 
an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit well-regarded for its flexible querying language and 
strong data visualization capabilities.

To channel PHP-FPM metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations must configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to gather PHP-FPM metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus 
format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's robust querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
undertaken using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and 
observability capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to create dynamic, 
interactive dashboards for a deeper examination of the metrics data, offering a comprehensive 
understanding of performance trends and potential issues in the PHP-FPM system.
