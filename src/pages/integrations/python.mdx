<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Send Python logs to your Logit.io Stack.

  <Callout type="info">
    This sample app was created and tested with `Python 3.11.2` and `pip 24.2` and `python-logstash-async 3.3.0`
  </Callout>

  ### Install

  Create a new directory for your project and name it `python_logs_example`.

  Open a Terminal window or Command Prompt and navigate into the new `python_logs_example` folder. 
  Create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies, this is done by entering the following command.

  <Tabs items={["Windows", "Linux/macOs/DEB/RPM"]}>

    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      python -m venv venv ^
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash copy
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  We now need to install the necessary logging and Logstash handler packages using pip:

  - `python-logstash-async`: Provides a handler for sending logs to Logstash

  The main advantage of using an asynchronous handler is that it sends logs to Logstash without blocking the main application thread. 
  We install it with the following command:

  ```bash copy
  pip install python-logstash-async
  ```

  Create two new files in the folder and call them `app.py` and `config.py`. There should now be 
  two files (and a folder called `venv`) in the `python_logs_example` folder.

  ### Configuring the App

  Copy and Paste the code below into `config.py`:

  <SendLogsViaPython />

  Copy and Paste the code below into `app.py`:

  ```python copy showLineNumbers 
  import logging
  from logstash_async.handler import AsynchronousLogstashHandler
  from logstash_async.handler import LogstashFormatter

  # Importing configuration variables from config.py
  from config import HOST, PORT, SSL_ENABLE

  def main():
    try:
      # Create the logger and set it's logging level
      logger = logging.getLogger("logstash")
      logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)   
      
      handler = AsynchronousLogstashHandler(
        host=HOST, 
        port=PORT, 
        ssl_enable=SSL_ENABLE, 
        ssl_verify=False,
        transport='logstash_async.transport.BeatsTransport',
        database_path='')
      
      # Here you can specify additional formatting on your log record/message
      formatter = LogstashFormatter()
      handler.setFormatter(formatter)
      
      # Assign handler to the logger
      logger.addHandler(handler)

      print("Sending logs to Logit.io.")
      
      # Send log records to Logstash 
      logger.error('python-logstash-async: test error message.')
      logger.info('python-logstash-async: test info message.')
      logger.warning('python-logstash-async: test warning message.')
      logger.debug('python-logstash-async: test debug message.')
      
      # Flush and close the handler to ensure all logs are sent
      # If the application crashes before buffered logs are flushed, 
      # some logs could be lost unless explicitly handled through mechanisms 
      # like flush intervals or proper shutdown processes
      handler.flush()  # Flush the log queue
      handler.close()  # Wait for background thread to finish

    except Exception as e:
      print(f"Failed to send log to Logit.io: {e}")
    
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
  ```

  ### Run the Python App

  Run the Python app with the following command in Terminal or the Command Prompt window.

  ```bash copy
  python app.py
  ```

  You will see feedback from the app so that you know that is running.

  Once the app has finished running, logs will have been sent to your Stack. The app sends an example of 
  an error log, an info log, a warning log and a debug log.

  <Callout type="info">
    This sample app was created and tested with

    `Python 3.9.13 (tags/v3.9.13:6de2ca5, May 17 2022, 16:36:42)`

    `pip 22.0.4`
  </Callout>

  ### Install

  Create a new directory for your project and name it `opentelemetry_python_example`.

  Open a Terminal window or Command Prompt and navigate into the new `opentelemetry_python_example` folder. 
  Create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies, this is done by entering the following command.

  <Tabs items={["Windows", "Linux/macOS/DEB/RPM"]}>

      ```bash copy
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  We now need to install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages using pip, the packages that we will be using are as follows:

  - `opentelemetry-api`: Core API for OpenTelemetry
  - `opentelemetry-sdk`: SDK implementation
  - `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`: Exporter to send data to the OpenTelemetry Collector or other OTLP-compatible backends
  - `opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask`: Automatically instrument your Flask applications for tracing with OpenTelemetry

  We install them with the following command.

  ```bash copy
  pip install flask opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
  ```

  Create two new files in the folder and call them `app.py` and `config.py`. There should now be a 
  two files in the `opentelemetry_python_example` folder and a folder called `venv`.

  ### Configuring the App

  Copy and Paste the code below into `config.py`.

  <MissingOtelDetailsCallout />

  ```python copy filename="config.py" /@opentelemetry.password/  /@opentelemetry.username/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/
  # config.py

  SERVICE_NAME = "LogitPythonTestApp"
  OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress"
  PORT = "@opentelemetry.httpsPort"
  USERNAME = "@opentelemetry.username"
  PASSWORD = "@opentelemetry.password"
  ```

  Copy and Paste the code below into `app.py`

  ```python copy filename="app.py" 
  # app.py

  import base64
  from datetime import datetime
  from opentelemetry import trace
  from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
  from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
  from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
  from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  # Importing configuration variables from config.py
  from config import SERVICE_NAME, OTLP_ENDPOINT, PORT, USERNAME, PASSWORD

  def get_basic_auth_header(username, password):
      """Encodes the username and password to base64 for Basic Auth."""
      credentials = f"{username}:{password}"
      auth_bytes = base64.b64encode(credentials.encode('utf-8'))
      auth_header = auth_bytes.decode('utf-8')
      return f"Basic {auth_header}"

  def init_tracer():
      # Create a Resource to associate with all traces
      resource = Resource.create({"service.name": SERVICE_NAME})

      # Set up the TracerProvider and add the OTLP HTTP exporter with Basic Auth
      tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
      trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

      # Generate the Basic Auth header
      auth_header = get_basic_auth_header(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
    
      #Generate the full endpoint
      endpoint = f"{OTLP_ENDPOINT}:{PORT}/v1/traces"

      # Create the OTLP HTTP exporter with the Basic Auth header
      otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
          endpoint=endpoint,
          headers={"Authorization": auth_header}
      )

      # Add the exporter to the tracer provider
      span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
      tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      # Initialize the tracer
      init_tracer()
      tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

      with tracer.start_as_current_span("parent-span") as parent_span:
          now = datetime.now()
          parent_span.set_attribute("FirstMessage", "This is a test!")
          parent_span.set_attribute("SecondMessage", "Message sent at " + now.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))

          # Start the second span within the first span
          with tracer.start_as_current_span("child-span") as child_span:
              child_span.set_attribute("FirstMessage", "This is another test!")
      
      with tracer.start_as_current_span("hello-span"):
          return "Hello, World!"
        

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
  ```

  ### Run the Python App

  Run the Python app with the following command in Terminal or the Command Prompt window.

  ```bash copy
  python app.py
  ```

  You will see feedback from the app so that you know that is running, make a note of the
  address and port that it is running on.

  ![Python Endpoint](@/images/integrations/python/python-endpoint.png)

  Open your browser and enter the address and port you made a note of in the previous step, the browser will return the following

  ![Browser Page](@/images/integrations/python/browser-page.png)

  The action of browsing to the page served by the Python app with sent traces to your Stack.
