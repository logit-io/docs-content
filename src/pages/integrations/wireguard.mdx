Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Wireguard metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Collect Wireguard server interface and peer statistics
  [[inputs.wireguard]]
    ## Optional list of Wireguard device/interface names to query.
    ## If omitted, all Wireguard interfaces are queried.
    # devices = ["wg0"]
  ```

### Telegraf Wireguard Overview

For the effective monitoring and analysis of Wireguard metrics across a distributed environment, 
it's critical to implement a robust metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server 
agent for collecting and reporting metrics, is ideally suited for this role. It can gather Wireguard 
metrics from various sources, including operational Wireguard instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf features a wide range of input plugins, allowing users to collect diverse metrics such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more, which are crucial for understanding Wireguard performance. 
To store and analyze these collected metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

To transmit Wireguard metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output 
metrics in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This involves setting up Telegraf to collect Wireguard metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the 
data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried 
out using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability features, 
is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth 
look at the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues 
in the Wireguard system.
