  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

```toml copy
[[inputs.prometheus]]

  urls = ["https://<teamcity_server_url>/app/metrics?experimental=true"]

  ## optional basic auth credentials
  username = "<your-username>"
  password = "<your-password>"
```

  ### Configure the output plugin

  <TelegrafOutputPlugin />

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />

  ### View your metrics

### Telegraf TeamCity Server Overview

For the successful monitoring and analysis of TeamCity metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to 
utilize a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent renowned 
for its metrics collection capabilities, is the perfect tool for harvesting TeamCity metrics from a variety 
of sources, which can include active TeamCity servers, databases, and other software applications.

Telegraf is equipped with a wide selection of input plugins, facilitating users to gather metrics from 
multiple sources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network activity, and more. To store and interrogate 
these collected metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting platform 
that boasts a flexible querying language and graphic data visualization.

In order to forward TeamCity metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure 
Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format and then employ Prometheus to scrape these metrics 
from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to amass TeamCity metrics and output 
them in the Prometheus format, orchestrating Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the Telegraf server, 
and subsequently analyzing and visualizing the data using Prometheus's flexible querying capabilities.

Once the metrics are successfully imported into Prometheus, they can be further analyzed and visualized 
using Grafana. Grafana, an open-source software for monitoring and observability, is seamlessly 
compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to craft dynamic, interactive dashboards to delve into 
metrics data, providing a deeper understanding of performance patterns and potential issues.
