Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Send your ESET logs to logit.io via logstash using the instructions below and begin searching your data.

  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Configuring ESET

  The use of ESET Admin Console, which is a locally installed management console, is recommended for organizations that need to send logs to a Syslog server. 

  <Callout type="info">
    Please note that the cloud management console does not support this functionality and is not compatible with the Syslog server integration.
  </Callout>

  ### Install the ESET certificate

  ESET sends data in an encrypted format. 

  You need to install the ESET certificate on your Filebeat server.

  ```ps1 copy
  sudo mkdir /etc/eset/certificates
  sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout /etc/filebeat/certificates/eset.key -x509 \
  -days 365 \
  -out /etc/filebeat/certificates/eset.crt
  ```

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

  ```yml copy filename="filebeat.yml" showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
  filebeat.inputs:
  - type: udp
    max_message_size: 10MiB
    host: "0.0.0.0:514"
    enabled: true

    fields:
      type: eset
    fields_under_root: true
    encoding: utf-8
    ignore_older: 12h

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
    loadbalance: true
    ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Configure ESET to output to syslog

  - Find the Server Settings section
  - Choose to enable the __Syslog server__ in the SYSLOG SERVER section

  Enter the details for your server

  - __Host__: Enter the host ip address
  - __Port__: Enter the port 6515 (unless you have changed the default)
  - __Format__: Select __BSD__
  - __Transport__: Select __TLS__

  Scroll down to the __LOGGING__ section

  - Ensure Export logs to Syslog is enabled
  - Choose JSON as the Exported logs format

### Cisco Meraki Logging Overview

ESET is an endpoint security solution that offers complete protection against various cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, and other forms of attacks. 
To effectively monitor and analyze endpoint activity, it's essential to have a dependable and efficient log management solution. ESET generates logs that contain 
information on endpoint activity, threats, and user behavior.

To manage these logs efficiently, organizations can utilize Filebeat, a log shipping tool that is open-source, to send logs from ESET to multiple destinations 
such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch, as it's both reliable and easy to use. Filebeat is widely employed for sending logs from ESET to various 
destinations, providing organizations with a centralized platform for collecting, processing, and visualizing security-related data.

To send ESET logs to Filebeat, organizations can set up ESET to forward logs to a syslog server and then use Filebeat to collect and forward log data to 
Elasticsearch or other destinations. This process includes configuring a syslog server to receive the logs, setting up ESET to send logs to the syslog server, 
and configuring Filebeat to collect and forward the logs from the syslog server to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

In conclusion, using Filebeat to send ESET logs to various destinations, such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana or OpenSearch, provides an effective and 
reliable log management solution. By configuring ESET to forward logs to a syslog server and using Filebeat to collect and forward the logs to Elasticsearch or 
other destinations, organizations can gain insights into endpoint activity, threats, and user behavior and take appropriate measures to safeguard their networks 
against cyber threats.
