Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Recommendations

  Logs sent via UDP are **not encrypted** and have **no delivery guarantee**.

  This input is supported for legacy reasons and Logit.io would not recommend setting up a new source integration sending via UDP if there is a better option available.

  ### Send data to UDP input

  Sending an example log to logstash with `logger`. Logger is available by default on Linux, macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
  Open a terminal and enter the following command. If you are logged in to your Logit.io account the host and
  port details should be populated with the correct values.

  ```bash copy
  logger -n @logstash.host -P @logstash.port "My log message here"
  ```

  Note that `logger` also sends metadata with the log message, such as the hostname and the time the log was sent.
