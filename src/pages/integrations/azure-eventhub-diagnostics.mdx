### Winlogbeat Installation Instructions Overview

Active Directory is a Microsoft technology that provides a centralized database for storing information about users, 
computers, and other resources on a network. It is widely used in enterprise environments to manage user accounts, 
permissions, and access to resources.

To effectively monitor and analyze security events in an Active Directory environment, it is essential to have a reliable 
and efficient log management solution. One way to achieve this is by using winlogbeat, an open-source log shipper that can 
be installed on a Windows server to collect and ship event logs to Logstash.

Winlogbeat is designed to work with the Elastic Stack, which includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch. By sending 
event logs from Active Directory to Logstash, organizations can centralize their log data and analyze it in real-time for 
threat detection and response.

In summary, using winlogbeat to ship logs from a Windows server to Logstash can provide organizations with a reliable and 
efficient way to monitor and analyze security events in their Active Directory environment. By centralizing log data and 
analyzing it in real-time, organizations can detect and respond to security threats quickly and effectively.
