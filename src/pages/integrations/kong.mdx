  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
### Ensure Kong is Installed Correctly

This guide recommends using the `TCP Log` Kong plugin. Please see the [TCP Log Documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/tcp-log/) for more detailed information.
        
Please ensure that you have Kong installed and at least one Kong service setup before continuing.

Instructions on how to install Kong, as well as how to setup a Kong service, can be found in the [Kong Documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/)

### Installing

You can either configure the TCP Log plugin to work with a Kong Service, Route or Consumer:
        
To configure the plugin to work on a Service, use:

```cmd copy
curl -X POST http://kong:8001/services/{service}/plugins \
    --data "name=tcp-log"  \
    --data "config.host=@logstash.host" \
    --data "config.port=@logstash.sslPort" \
    --data "config.tls=true"        
```

To configure the plugin to work on a Route, use:

```cmd copy
curl -X POST http://kong:8001/routes/{route_id}/plugins \
    --data "name=tcp-log"  \
    --data "config.host=@logstash.host" \
    --data "config.port=@logstash.sslPort" \
    --data "config.tls=true"        
```

To configure the plugin to work on a Consumer, use:

```cmd copy
curl -X POST http://kong:8001/plugins \
    --data "name=tcp-log" \
    --data "consumer_id={consumer_id}"  \
    --data "config.host=@logstash.host"" \
    --data "config.port=@logstash.sslPort" \
    --data "config.tls=true"            
```

If running the curl request in Powershell replace the backslashes with backticks.

### Sending Logs

You can use your Logit.io stack's Logstash Pipelines to better structure incoming Kong logs.

### Kong Logging Overview

Kong is an open source Lua app created on [Nginx](/integrations/log-management/applications/nginx) that 
is commonly used as an API gateway for microservices. The application is highly scalable & 
provides users with load balancing, authentication, and a variety of other useful 
functionality through the addition of plugins.

Kong is also known as an API middleware as it gives users a way to securely manage 
communication between clients and microservices. As well as being able to scale 
horizontally, Kong also benefits from being able to run across on premise, 
cloud & hybrid cloud environments.

The application generates a wide variety of logs with varying severities for further 
analysis & parsing including debug, info, warn, error, crit & general Kong access logs.

If we were to look at a few of the priority logging types we would want to 
focus on warning logs to spot any early issues we can get ahead of, error logs 
to observe at what rate they are being created & critical logs to 
discover why Kong may not be functioning as expected.

With all these log types it can be hard to know where to start to grasp a top 
level view of the overall health of your Kong services. Our 
Kong [log analyser](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/log-analysis) can centralise 
all of your Kong & any additional Nginx log data in a single platform for observability, 
reporting & reducing your mean time to resolution (MTTR).

Logit.io uses highly available tools including Logtstash, Kibana & Elasticsearch to 
help you make the most out of log analysis & [container monitoring](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/container-monitoring/) to 
make your business's infrastructure fully scalable & ready for growth. 

If you need any further help to analyse your Kong logs we're here to help.
