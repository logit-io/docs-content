Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Configure a Palo Alto firewall to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/> 
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Palo Alto Logging

  __Configure the Palo Alto Networks firewall to log to a syslog server:__

  You can configure the Palo Alto firewall to log to a syslog server through the admin console. To configure, go to the "Device" tab and choose "System" -> "Syslog". 

  Add a new Syslog Server Profile and give the profile a descriptive name that includes "Logitio"

  * Name: Enter a name that includes Filebeat
  * Syslog Server: Your Filebeat server IP address
  * Transport: UDP
  * Port: 514
  * Format: BSD
  * Facility: Remains as "LOG_USER"

  Save the profile.

  [Read more](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os) about how to configure Syslog Monitoring with Palo Alto Networks.

  To configure logging for a security policy, follow these steps:

  * Go to the __Policies__ tab and select __Security__ from the left menu.
  * Double-click an existing security policy or create a new one to open the Security Policy Rule dialog.
  * Navigate to the Action tab and select __Log at Session Start__ and __Log at Session End__.
  * Choose the __log forwarding profile__ that you created above.
  * Ensure all required information highlighted is entered.

  Commit and save all changes to your firewall.

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

    ```yml copy filename="filebeat.yml" showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
    ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs:
    - type: udp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:514"
      enabled: true

      fields:
        type: paloalto
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 12h

    # ================================== Outputs ===================================
    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true
    ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Validate configuration

    <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />
    
  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Launch OpenSearch Dashboards to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />

### Palo Alto Overview

Palo Alto Networks firewalls provide advanced network security features for enterprise environments, protecting against 
cyber threats and unauthorized access. To effectively monitor and analyze network activity, it is essential to have a 
reliable and efficient log management solution. The Palo Alto Networks firewalls generate logs that capture information 
about network traffic, threats, and user activity.

To manage these logs effectively, organizations can use Filebeat, an open-source shipping tool, to send logs from Palo 
Alto Networks firewalls to various destinations, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, due to its reliability 
and minimal memory footprint. Filebeat is widely used to send logs from Palo Alto Networks firewalls to various destinations, 
including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, due to its compatibility and ease of use.

To send Palo Alto Networks firewall logs to Filebeat, organizations can configure the firewall to forward logs to a syslog 
server, and then use Filebeat to collect and forward log data to Elasticsearch or other destinations. This process involves 
setting up a syslog server to receive the logs, configuring the firewall to send logs to the syslog server, and configuring 
Filebeat to collect and forward the logs from the syslog server to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

Filebeat provides a filebeat.yml wizard that helps users avoid complex logging concerns, such as large registry files and 
frequent errors encountered when handling deleted or renamed log files. Users can also consider using the Hosted ELK service 
to simplify tracking numerous pipelines using this shipper.

In summary, using Filebeat to send Palo Alto Networks firewall logs to various destinations, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, 
and Kibana, is a reliable and efficient log management solution. By configuring the firewall to forward logs to a syslog server 
and using Filebeat to collect and forward the logs to Elasticsearch or other destinations, organizations can gain insights into 
network traffic, threats, and user activity, and take action to protect their networks against cyber threats and unauthorized 
access.
