## Telegraf Google Network Topology Platform metrics Overview

To effectively manage and optimize the network performance within Google Cloud, it is important to 
have visibility into the network topology and its associated metrics. Google Cloud provides various 
monitoring and analysis tools, including Network Intelligence Center and Stackdriver, to gather and analyze network metrics.

Network Intelligence Center offers comprehensive insights into network performance and connectivity, 
allowing organizations to identify and troubleshoot network issues. Stackdriver provides monitoring 
and alerting capabilities, allowing users to monitor network performance metrics, track network traffic, 
and set up notifications for anomalies or outages.

Additionally, organizations can leverage third-party network monitoring and management solutions, 
such as Telegraf, Prometheus, and Grafana, to collect and analyze network metrics across distributed systems. 
These solutions offer flexible data collection, advanced querying, and visualization capabilities to gain 
deeper insights into network performance, traffic patterns, and potential optimization opportunities.
