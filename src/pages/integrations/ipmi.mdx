Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship IPMI metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Read metrics from the bare metal servers via IPMI
  [[inputs.ipmi_sensor]]
    ## optionally specify the path to the ipmitool executable
    # path = "/usr/bin/ipmitool"
    ##
    ## Setting 'use_sudo' to true will make use of sudo to run ipmitool.
    ## Sudo must be configured to allow the telegraf user to run ipmitool
    ## without a password.
    # use_sudo = false
    ##
    ## optionally force session privilege level. Can be CALLBACK, USER, OPERATOR, ADMINISTRATOR
    # privilege = "ADMINISTRATOR"
    ##
    ## optionally specify one or more servers via a url matching
    ##  [username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]
    ##  e.g.
    ##    root:passwd@lan(127.0.0.1)
    ##
    ## if no servers are specified, local machine sensor stats will be queried
    ##
    # servers = ["USERID:PASSW0RD@lan(192.168.1.1)"]

    ## Recommended: use metric 'interval' that is a multiple of 'timeout' to avoid
    ## gaps or overlap in pulled data
    interval = "30s"

    ## Timeout for the ipmitool command to complete. Default is 20 seconds.
    timeout = "20s"

    ## Schema Version: (Optional, defaults to version 1)
    metric_version = 2

    ## Optionally provide the hex key for the IMPI connection.
    # hex_key = ""

    ## If ipmitool should use a cache
    ## for me ipmitool runs about 2 to 10 times faster with cache enabled on HP G10 servers (when using ubuntu20.04)
    ## the cache file may not work well for you if some sensors come up late
    # use_cache = false

    ## Path to the ipmitools cache file (defaults to OS temp dir)
    ## The provided path must exist and must be writable
    # cache_path = ""

  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

### Telegraf IPMI Overview

To efficiently monitor and analyze IPMI metrics across diverse systems, it's crucial to implement a reliable and effective metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent used for collecting and transmitting telemetry data, is exceptionally suitable for this task. 
It can gather IPMI metrics from a multitude of sources, such as operational servers, hardware monitoring interfaces, and other associated 
applications.

Telegraf comes with an extensive variety of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from different sources, such as CPU usage, memory 
utilization, temperature readings, fan speeds, and more. All these metrics are important for understanding the health and performance of 
hardware systems managed through IPMI. To store and analyze these collected metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting tool, recognized for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

To transfer IPMI metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format and 
then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect IPMI metrics, 
outputting them in the Prometheus format, setting up Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then interpreting the 
data using Prometheus's robust querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth exploration of the metrics data, delivering a comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential hardware issues managed through IPMI.
