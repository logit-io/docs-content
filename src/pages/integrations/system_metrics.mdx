<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship system metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the plugin

  The default `telegraf.conf` configuration file is thousands of lines long so, for simplicity, we will create a new
  configuration file for this guide.
  Create a new text file and copy the configuration details below into it and save it as `telegraf-demo.conf` in 
  the directory where Telegraf has been installed.

  The configuration below will scrape a selection of system metrics from the machine you have installed Telegraf 
  on and these will be sent to your Logit.io stack. Metrics include CPU, memory and disk usage and system metrics 
  such as system load and uptime.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  # Read metrics about cpu usage
  [[inputs.cpu]]
      ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
      percpu = true
      ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
      totalcpu = true
      ## If true collect raw cpu time metrics
      collect_cpu_time = true
      ## If true compute and report the sum of all non-idle cpu states
      report_active = true
  
  # Read metrics about memory usage
  [[inputs.mem]]
  
  # Read metrics about system load & uptime
  [[inputs.system]]
      namepass = ["system"]
  
  # Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
  [[inputs.disk]]
      ## By default, telegraf gather stats for all mountpoints.
      ## Setting mountpoints will restrict the stats to the specified mountpoints.
      # mount_points = ["/"]
  
      ## Ignore some mountpoints by filesystem type. For example (dev)tmpfs (usually
      ## present on /run, /var/run, /dev/shm or /dev).
      ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs"]
  
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"
  
  [outputs.http.headers]
  Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
  Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />

  ### Launch Metrics to View Data

  Click the 'Launch Metrics' button below to open the infrastructure metrics visualizer. 
  
  <LaunchVisualizer type="metrics" />
  
  Once opened, click on the Explore option in the left-hand menu:
  ![Grafana Explore](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-explore.png)
  
  Under the Metric header you will see 'Select metric'. Open the drop-down menu 
  and scroll to and select 'mem_used':
  ![Grafana Select Metric](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-metric.png)

  Click on the blue Run query button near the top-right of the screen:
  ![Grafana Run Query](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-run-query.png)

  You will now see the 'mem_used' metric data displayed and if you click on the blue Run query button this will be updated.
  You can set this to automatically update by clicking on the arrow on the blue button and chosing the interval you want the 
  data to be updated.

  When you want to stop Telegraf sending metric data press Ctrl + C in the terminal app / Powershell.
