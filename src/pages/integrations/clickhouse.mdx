Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship ClickHouse metrics to your Logit.io stacks.

  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy filename="telegraf.conf" showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Read metrics from one or many ClickHouse servers
  [[inputs.clickhouse]]
    ## Username for authorization on ClickHouse server
    username = "default"

    ## Password for authorization on ClickHouse server
    # password = ""

    ## HTTP(s) timeout while getting metrics values
    ## The timeout includes connection time, any redirects, and reading the
    ## response body.
    # timeout = 5s

    ## List of servers for metrics scraping
    ## metrics scrape via HTTP(s) clickhouse interface
    ## https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/http/
    servers = ["http://127.0.0.1:8123"]

    ## If "auto_discovery"" is "true" plugin tries to connect to all servers
    ## available in the cluster with using same "user:password" described in
    ## "user" and "password" parameters and get this server hostname list from
    ## "system.clusters" table. See

    # auto_discovery = true

    ## Filter cluster names in "system.clusters" when "auto_discovery" is "true"
    ## when this filter present then "WHERE cluster IN (...)" filter will apply
    ## please use only full cluster names here, regexp and glob filters is not

### Telegraf ClickHouse metrics Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze ClickHouse metrics in a distributed environment, having a reliable and efficient metrics management 
solution is key. Telegraf, an open-source agent known for collecting and sending metrics, is a perfect tool for gathering ClickHouse metrics 
from numerous sources, such as operational ClickHouse databases, other related applications, and the underlying infrastructure.

Telegraf boasts an array of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from diverse sources like CPU usage, memory consumption, network 
activity, and many more. For storing and querying these amassed metrics, organizations can employ Prometheus, an open-source system that offers 
both monitoring and alerting capabilities. This tool supports a flexible querying language and has strong graphical data visualization features.

To ship ClickHouse metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format. Then, 
they can use Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect ClickHouse metrics 
and output them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visualizing and 
analyzing the data using Prometheus's versatile querying and visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics are in Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be performed using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform that's 
perfect for monitoring and observability and is entirely compatible with Prometheus. It provides users with the tools to create dynamic and 
interactive dashboards, enabling them to dig deeper into the metrics data.
