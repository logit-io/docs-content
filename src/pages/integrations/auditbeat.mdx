Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Auditbeat is an open source shipping agent that lets you ship audit data to one or more destinations, including Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Install Auditbeat

  To get started first follow the steps below:
    
  - [Install auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/auditbeat-installation-configuration.html#install)
  - Root access
  - Verify the required port @logstash.sslPort is open

  _Older versions can be found here:
  [auditbeat 7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/7.17/auditbeat-installation-configuration.html#install),
  [auditbeat 6](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/6.8/auditbeat-installation.html),
  [auditbeat 5](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/5.6/auditbeat-installation.html)_

  ### Configure Modules

 <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "Windows", "macOS"]} unlink>
    <Tab>
      * __deb/rpm__ (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/CentOS/RHEL/Fedora): `/etc/auditbeat/auditbeat.yml`
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      * __Windows:__ `C:\Program Files\auditbeat\auditbeat.yml`
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      * __Mac:__ `<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/auditbeat.yml`
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  By default, the `file_integrity` module will be enabled. This module watches for file changes such as when a file is created, updated or deleted. 
  When a change is detected, auditbeat will send events containing metadata to one or more configured output sources (e.g. Logstash). 

  The module can be configured in `auditbeat.yml` by adding or removing path addresses. Auditbeat will watch for changes in files relative to these paths.

    There is also a full example configuration file called auditbeat.reference.yml that shows all the possible options.
  </Callout>

  ### Configure output

  We'll be shipping to Logstash so that we have the option to run filters before the data is indexed.  
  Comment out the elasticsearch output block.

  ```yaml copy
  ## Comment out elasticsearch output
  #output.elasticsearch:
  #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  ```
  
  Uncomment and change the logstash output to match below:

  ```yaml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
    loadbalance: true
    ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  ### Validate Configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="auditbeat" />

  ### Start Auditbeat

  Start or restart [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/master/auditbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="beats" utmCampaign="auditbeat" source="auditbeat" />

### Auditbeat Logging Overview

Auditbeat is one of the most recent additions to Elastic Stack's Beats. 
It is primarily used to gather audit data on user activity and processes 
running on your server's infrastructure. Additionally, Auditbeat can be 
used to detect crucial and unexpected changes to configuration files & binaries.

This can be key to helping you to 
identify [compliance](https://logit.io/solutions/compliance-and-auditing) issues 
and [security](https://logit.io/about-us/security) violations in your organisation. 
Once configured, changes to the file are updated in real-time to your output, 
allowing for optimised visibility of security-related instances. It can be used 
directly to undertake these processes & gather data without the need to 
access Linux's [Auditd](/integrations/auditd/).

Centralising your Auditbeat event data using a log management system such as 
Logit.io provides a way of easily managing your ELK Stack overheads in one single platform.
