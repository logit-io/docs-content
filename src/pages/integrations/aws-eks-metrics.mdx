Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  VMAgent is a tiny but mighty agent which helps you collect metrics from various sources and store them in VictoriaMetrics.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
### AWS CLI Install

Firstly Make sure you have the aws cli, eksctl & kubectl installed on local machine 
using the [following guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).

Also make sure you have set up aws configure with your AWS credentials. 

To do this run run the following command in your aws terminal.

```cmd copy
aws configure
```

When you type this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: 
access key, secret access key, AWS Region, and output format. 

This information is stored in a profile named default. 
This profile is used when you run commands, unless you specify another one.

### Connecting to the cluster

Update your config by running the following command. Replace `<enter_region>` and 
`<enter_name>` with your AWS cluster region and name.

```cmd copy
aws eks --region <enter_region> update-kubeconfig --name <enter_name>
```

Check you can connect to your cluster by running the following command:

```cmd copy
kubectl get svc
```

### Confirm you have Helm installed
Confirm you have Helm installed and available. 
If not, please refer to the [Helm installation documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Add VictoriaMetrics Helm Chart

Run the following to add the Victoria Metrics Helm chart.

```cmd copy
helm repo add vm https://victoriametrics.github.io/helm-charts/
```

### Export default configuration yaml

  Export the default configuration to a yaml file so that we can make an edit.

```cmd copy
helm show values vm/victoria-metrics-agent >> vmagent-kubernetes.yml
```

### Add remoteWriteUrls

Open the exported configuration in a text editor to add in the remoteWriteUrls.

You will need to edit Line 65 of the `vmagent-kubernetes.yml`

From:

```yaml copy 
# WARN: need to specify at least one remote write url or one multi tenant url
remoteWriteUrls: []
# remoteWriteUrls:
#   - http://vm-insert:8480/insert/0/prometheus
#   - http://prometheus:8480/insert/0/prometheus
```

To:

```yaml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
# WARN: need to specify at least one remote write url or one multi tenant url
remoteWriteUrls: ["https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"]
# remoteWriteUrls:
#   - http://vm-insert:8480/insert/0/prometheus
#   - http://prometheus:8480/insert/0/prometheus
```

### Install Helm Chart
You are now ready to install the helm chart.

```cmd copy
helm --namespace=victoriametrics install vmagent vm/victoria-metrics-agent --create-namespace -f vmagent-kubernetes.yml
```
</Steps>

## AWS EKS Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from AWS EKS streamlines monitoring and log management 
for your containerized applications, empowering you with insights into their 
performance and security. You can further enhance your infrastructure with Amazon 
CloudFront to ensure high availability and low latency, by integrating 
[AWS Lambda](/integrations/aws-cloudwatch-lambda) and [CloudWatch](/integrations/cloudwatch/#metrics) to 
monitor serverless functions in real-time. Logit.io's [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/) 
offers a fully scalable experience with these integrations.
