Metricbeat is an open-source shipping agent used to collect and ship 
operating system and service metrics to your Logit.io Stack 
via [Logstash](/integrations/log-management/shippers/logstash).

      To get started you will need to install metricbeat. To do this you have two main options:
        
      - Choose the [metricbeat](https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-8.15.2-windows-x86_64.zip) ZIP file (Windows ZIP x86_64) or
      - Choose the [Microsoft Software Installer MSI](https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-8.15.2-windows-x86_64.msi) file (Windows MSI x86_64 (beta))

      <Callout type="info">
        To successfully install metricbeat and set up the required Windows service you will need to have administrator access. 
      </Callout>

      __If you have chosen to download the zip file:__

      - Extract the contents of the zip file into C:\Program Files.
      - Rename the extracted folder to metricbeat
      - Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon and select Run As Administrator).
      - From the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to install metricbeat as a Windows service:

      ```cmd copy
      cd 'C:\Program Files\metricbeat'
      ```

      ```cmd copy
      .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1
      ```

      If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: 

      ```cmd copy
      PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1
      ```

      For more information about Powershell execution policies see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4).

      __If you have chosen to download the metricbeat.msi file:__

      - double-click on it and the relevant files will be downloaded. 

      At the end of the installation process you'll be given the option to open the folder where metricbeat has been installed.

      - Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon and select Run As Administrator).
      - From the PowerShell prompt, change directory to the location where metricbeat was installed and run the following command to install metricbeat as a Windows service:

      ```cmd copy
      .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1
      ```

      If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: 

      ```cmd copy
      PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1
      ```

      To get started you will need to install metricbeat. To do this you have two main options:

      - Choose the AMD / Intel file (x86_64) or
      - Choose the ARM file (arm64)
                                      
      You can tell if you have a Linux PC with an AMD / Intel CPU (kernel) architecture by opening a terminal and running the `uname -m` command. If it displays ___x86_64___ you have AMD / Intel architecture.
