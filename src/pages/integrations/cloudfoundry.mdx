Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Get started with Cloud Foundry log drain monitoring by following our configuration 
  guide below and start sending logs to Logstash & Elasticsearch.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Setup Log Drain

  Create the log drain service in Cloud Foundry.

  ```cmd copy
  cf cups logit-ssl-drain -l syslog-tls://@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort
  ```

  ### Bind the Service

  Create the log drain service in Cloud Foundry.

  ```cmd copy
  cf bind-service YOUR-CF-APP-NAME logit-ssl-drain
  ```

  ### Restage/Push the Service

  ```cmd copy
  cf restage YOUR-CF-APP-NAME
  ```

  OR

  ```cmd copy
  cf push YOUR-CF-APP-NAME
  ```

## Cloud Foundry Logging Overview

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform as a service (PaaS) developed by VMware. 
Cloud Foundry supports the entire application development lifecycle from an 
application's initial inception all the way through to testing and deploying. 

The multi-cloud environment provided by Cloud Foundry's platform supports many 
commonly used programming languages, including; [Golang](/integrations/golang), 
[Ruby](/integrations/ruby), [Python](/integrations/python) and [.Net Core](/integrations/dotnet).

Cloud Foundry assists developers that may not know how to set up their own database, web server 
or load balancer by providing a solution for these common roadblocks to deploying and operating apps.

The PaaS generates a number of logs, these include; STG, RTR, Zipkin, LGR, APP, SSH, 
CELL and Cloud Foundry API logs. With all these log types and status being generated 
by a single platform, it can be difficult to parse, transform and identify which of 
your cloud foundry logs may be of highest importance and which logs need to be 
visualised for further insights and reporting.

Thanks to our hosted Logstash solution, Logit.io makes parsing, sending and managing 
your logs from Cloud Foundry fast and effective. Our universal [log viewer](https://logit.io/solutions/log-viewer) 
is able to process logs across tools, platforms and programming languages that you use on a daily basis.
