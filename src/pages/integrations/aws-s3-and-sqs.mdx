Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs
 
  We will be configuring one or more S3 buckets to generate notifications when Objects are created.  
  Then using those notifications to consume newly created objects without having to list the full contents of the S3 bucket.
 
  This particularly suits buckets containing a large number of objects e.g. cloudtrail logs.
 
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
 
  ### Before you begin
 
  You will need to know the ARN (amazon resource name) for your S3 bucket(s) and the SQS queue will need to be created in the same region as the bucket(s).
 
  ### Create SQS queue
 
  From within the AWS console, navigate to **Simple Queue Service**, then confirm your are in the **same** region as your S3 bucket.
 
  Click **Create queue**
 
  Type: Standard  
  Name: *Name of your queue*  
  Visibility timeout: 5 minutes  
  Message retention period: 7 days  
  Access policy: Choose **Advanced** and use the policy template below.
 
  This will grant the listed S3 buckets permission to send messages to the SQS queue.  
  **Make sure you update with Resource details for your SQS queue and the name of your S3 bucket(s)**  
  If you only have one bucket, delete the 2nd line and remove the trailing comma on the line above.
  
  ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Principal": "*",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:<region>:<account id>:<queue name>",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "sqs:SendMessage"
                ],
                "Condition": {
                    "ArnLike": {
                        "aws:SourceArn": [
                            "arn:aws:s3:::<1st bucket name>",
                            "arn:aws:s3:::<2nd bucket name>"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
  ```
 
  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**
 
  ### Configure the S3 bucket
 
  If you have multiple buckets you will need to repeat this section for each bucket.  
  From within the AWS console, navigate to **S3** and select your bucket.
 
  Click the **Properties** tab, scroll down to **Event notifications** and **Create event notification**
 
  Event name: *Name of your Event*  
  Prefix + Suffix: *are optional and can be used to restrict notifications to only some object paths or names*  
  Events: *select* **All object create events**  
  *Scroll to near the bottom of the page*  
  Destination: SQS queue  
  SQS queue: *Choose your queue from the drop down*  
 
  Make sure you **Save changes**
  
  To Test your configuration - if you create a new object in your bucket, you should see the number of messages in your SQS queue increase.
 
  ### Create iam user/policy
 
  This will create a single policy/user to access the SQS queue and read from the S3 buckets.  
  If you wish to use separate users for this, split the statements into multiple policies.

  From within the AWS console, navigate to IAM (Identity and Access Management) and open **Policies** from the left menu
 
  Click **Create policy**, select **JSON** and use the policy template below.
 
  This will grant the ability to consume messages off the SQS queue, along with list and read objects in the S3 bucket(s)  
  **Make sure you update with Resource details for your SQS queue and the name of your S3 bucket(s)**  
  If you only have one bucket, delete the 2nd bucket lines and remove the trailing comma on the line above.


  ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "sqs:Get*",
                    "sqs:List*",
                    "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                    "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility*",
                    "sqs:DeleteMessage*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:sqs:<region>:<account id>:<queue name>"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:Get*",
                    "s3:List*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<1st bucket name>",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<1st bucket name>/*",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<2nd bucket name>",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<2nd bucket name>/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
  ```
 
  Click **next**
 
  Name your policy appropriately and **Create policy**
 
  Then open **Users** and **Create user**
 
  Name: *Name for your user*
  
  Click **next**
  
  Permission options: Attach policies directly  
  Permission policies: *Find and select the policy you just created*  
 
  Click **next** and then **Create User**
 
  Select the user you just created, select **Security credentials**, scroll down to **Access keys** and **Create access key**  
  Choose **Third-party service**, acknowledge the warning and click **Next**  
  Set a description (optional) and click **Create access key**
  
  Note down your access keys, you will need them later.

  **Populate the Input form**
 
  You should now have all the details you need to fill in the SQS S3 input form at `https://dashboard.logit.io/a/<account-id>/s/<stack-id>/logs-settings/add-input/s3-sqs`
