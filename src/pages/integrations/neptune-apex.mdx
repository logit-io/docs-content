Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Neptune Apex metrics to your Logit.io stacks
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  # Neptune Apex data collector
  [[inputs.neptune_apex]]
    ## The Neptune Apex plugin reads the publicly available status.xml data from a local Apex.
    ## Measurements will be logged under "apex".

    ## The base URL of the local Apex(es). If you specify more than one server, they will
    ## be differentiated by the "source" tag.
    servers = ["http://apex.local",]

    ## The response_timeout specifies how long to wait for a reply from the Apex.
    #response_timeout = "5s"

  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"

### Telegraf Neptune Apex Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze Neptune Apex metrics in a distributed environment, it's vital to have a robust 
and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is ideally suited for this task, 
capable of gathering Neptune Apex metrics from a variety of sources, including operational Neptune Apex devices, databases, 
and other relevant applications.

Telegraf provides a comprehensive selection of input plugins, enabling users to gather metrics from various sources such as 
CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and more. For storing and analyzing these harvested metrics, organizations 
can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting tool known for its flexible querying language and impressive 
graphical data visualization capabilities.

To transfer Neptune Apex metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process 
involves configuring Telegraf to collect Neptune Apex metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, setting up 
Prometheus to pull these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's 
dynamic querying and graphical visualization features.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. 
Grafana is an open-source platform celebrated for its monitoring and observability capabilities, and it is fully compatible 
with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper understanding of the metrics data, 
providing a comprehensive view of performance trends and potential issues.
