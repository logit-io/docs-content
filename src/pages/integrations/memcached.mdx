<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Memcached metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many memcached servers.
  [[inputs.memcached]]
    # An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip on hostname
    # with optional port. ie localhost, 10.0.0.1:11211, etc.
    servers = ["localhost:11211"]
    # An array of unix memcached sockets to gather stats about.
    # unix_sockets = ["/var/run/memcached.sock"]

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # enable_tls = false
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## If false, skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = true
  ```

### Telegraf Memcached Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of Memcached metrics across a distributed environment, it's essential to have a robust metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent designed for collecting and reporting metrics, fits this role perfectly. It can gather Memcached 
metrics from a variety of sources, including operational Memcached instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf features a wide array of input plugins, enabling users to collect various metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, 
and more. These metrics are crucial for understanding Memcached performance. To store and scrutinize these metrics, organizations can use 
Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and powerful data visualization capabilities.

To relay Memcached metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Memcached 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth exploration of the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential issues in the Memcached system.
