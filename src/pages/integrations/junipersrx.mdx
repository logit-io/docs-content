Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Configure a Juniper SRX firewall to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>  
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Juniper SRX Logging

  __Configure the Juniper SRX firewall to log to a syslog server:__

  Ensure that your Juniper firewall is configured to send logs to your Filebeat server, meeting the required configuration criteria:

  * Log format: syslog
  * Send over: UDP
  * IP Address: FILEBEAT-IP-ADDRESS
  * Port: 514

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

    ```yml copy filename="filebeat.yml" showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
    ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs:
    - type: udp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:514"
      enabled: true

      fields:
        type: fortigate
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 12h

    # ================================== Outputs ===================================
    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true
    ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Validate configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="junipersrx" source="Juniper_SRX" />

### Juniper SRX Overview

Enterprises can rely on Juniper SRX firewalls for advanced network security in protecting against cyber threats and 
unauthorized access. However, to effectively monitor and analyze network activity, a reliable and efficient log management 
solution is essential. Luckily, the Juniper SRX firewalls generate logs that capture valuable information about network 
traffic, threats, and user activity.

Organizations can effectively manage these logs by using Filebeat, an open-source shipping tool, to send logs from Juniper 
SRX firewalls to various destinations, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Filebeat's reliability and minimal 
memory footprint make it a popular choice for sending logs to different destinations. It's also compatible and easy to use.

To send Juniper SRX firewall logs to Filebeat, organizations need to configure the firewall to forward logs to a syslog 
server, and then use Filebeat to collect and forward log data to Elasticsearch or other destinations. This involves 
setting up a syslog server to receive the logs, configuring the firewall to send logs to the syslog server, and configuring 
Filebeat to collect and forward the logs from the syslog server to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

Filebeat offers a filebeat.yml wizard to help users avoid complex logging concerns, such as large registry files and 
frequent errors encountered when handling deleted or renamed log files. Additionally, users can opt to use our Hosted ELK 
service to simplify tracking numerous pipelines using this shipper.
