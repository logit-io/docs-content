Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Export Logs to Google Pub/Sub

  Ensure that you have Cloud Run logs configured in [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs).

  Now we can filter the logs as needed, by clicking on the service name and choosing Show matching entries as shown below.

  ![Filter the logs that we want to export](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/filter_logs.png)

  <Callout type="info">
    Read more about how to configure and export logs using the [Google Operations Console](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2)
  </Callout>

  ### Create A Sink

  To export the logs choose Create sink as shown below.

  ![Select sink service](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss2.png)
  You will be then be prompted for:
  - Sink details (enter a name)
  - Sink destination (choose Cloud Pub/Sub topic creating a new topic if needed)
  - Choose logs to include in sink (this will have a filter applied already if you filtered the logs above)

  Choose Create sink to continue.

  ![Fill in edit sink form](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss3.png)

  ### Create Google Pub/Sub

  Locate your newly created [Pub/Sub topic](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/) and choose Create subscription.

  ![Find topic in Topics menu](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss5.png)
  
  Enter a suitable Subscription ID and leave the delivery type as pull.

  We don't need to change anything further at this stage, scroll to the bottom and choose CREATE to create the Subscription.

  ### Create Service Account

  Now in [service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), choose the project you're working with. 
      
  Then select CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT, this account will be used to retrieve logs from the Pub/Sub and send them to Logit.io.

  ![Service accounts screenshot](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss8.png)

  Name the service account and in step 2 add the role Pub/Sub Subscriber as shown below, then choose DONE.
  
  ![View new service account](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss11.png)

  Now choose Manage keys as shown below.

  ![Add key using dropdown](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss12.png)

  Then choose ADD KEY > Create new key, choosing the recommended JSON format. This will download the JSON key to your machine ready to use in the next step.

  ![Add key using dropdown](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss13.png)

  ### Configuring Logstash

  To start pulling logs and metrics from the Google Cloud Platform to your Stack you need to configure a Google Cloud Platform Input on your Logit.io Stack.

  <ConfigurePubSub type="" utmSource="pubsubbeat" utmMedium="google" utmCampaign="googlecloudrun"/>

  <Callout type="info">
    Logit.io will verify your input before it is applied, we will contact you to confirm when this has been completed.
  </Callout>

  ### Launch Logs to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />
</Steps>

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Google Cloud Run metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Set Credentials in GCP

  <SetGCPCredentials intro="Google Cloud Run emerges as a unique collection of services nested within Google Cloud. It's specifically devised for the development, deployment, and management of containers, stimulating secure and efficient communication among diverse software units within a cloud-oriented ecosystem."/>
  
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  <TelegrafStackDriverInput metric_type="run.googleapis.com"/>

  ### Configure the output plugin

  <TelegrafOutputPlugin />

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />

  ### Launch Metrics to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="metrics" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />
</Steps>

## Cloud Run Logging Overview

Google Cloud Run is a container-as-a-service (CaaS) solution from Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offering the ability to run stateless containers 
that are invocable via web requests or Pub/Sub events. Similar to platforms like Microsoft Azure Functions and AWS Lambda, Cloud Run is efficient 
in terms of cost, often being more economical than its counterparts.

Cloud Run maintains a detailed log of operations, user activities, and system messages, providing transparency and aiding in compliance and 
audit requirements. Emphasis is placed on operational logs for optimal monitoring practices. These logs are essential in troubleshooting 
and optimizing applications on Cloud Run.

For effective log management, integrating Google Cloud Run logs with analytical tools like Hosted OpenSearch and Kibana through platforms 
such as Logit.io can offer deep insights, allowing for centralized monitoring across services, including those not hosted on GCP. 
Pre-set alerts and health checks keep you informed about your containerized applications' status and performance.
    
You can use Google Cloud Run logs & metrics to visualise the performance of your services in 
[Hosted OpenSearch](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-kibana/) for intelligent reporting & by using our 
[log analysis platform](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/log-analysis) you can correlate the performance of your Cloud Run Services 
with the rest of your applications (even those based outside of Google services).
