  ### GCP Workspace

  Google Workspace encompasses a suite of cloud-based computing tools, productivity applications, and collaborative solutions developed and offered by Google. Sending logs from Google Workspace to Logit.io can be achieved through the utilization of Filebeat and the Google Reports API.

  1. **Set Up a Service Account:**
    - Follow the [official Google Workspace tutorial](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/10839762?sjid=10874551070185788155-EU#zippy=%2Cstep-use-google-cloud-to-turn-on-apis) for IAM-based service account setup.

  2. **Grant Admin SDK API Access:**
    - Enable access to the following APIs and services:
      - [Admin SDK](http://admin.google.com/)
      - People API or Contacts API.
      - Google Workspace Migrate API
      - Gmail API
      - Google Calendar API
      - Google Drive API
      - Groups Migration API
      - Groups Settings API
      - Google Sheets API
      - Tasks API

  3. **Delegate Domain-Wide Authority to Your Service Account:**
    - Open your [Google Workspace Admin console](http://admin.google.com/).
    - Navigate to Main menu > Security > API controls.
    - In the Domain-wide delegation pane, select Manage Domain Wide Delegation.
    - If the option is not visible, switch to a super-admin Google Workspace account.
    - Access Manage Domain Wide Delegation and click Add new.
      - Fill in the details:
        - Client ID: Found in the service account's details under Unique ID and in the client_id field of the auto-downloaded credentials file.
        - OAuth Scopes: Enter the admin's API.
      - Click Authorize to confirm your changes.
  
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />
  
  ### Update Your Configuration File

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.
        
  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of __filebeat.yml__.
  
  For version `7.16+` and above, use the configuration below:

  ```yml copy
  fields:
    type: google_workspace

  # ============================== Filebeat modules ==============================
  filebeat.modules:
  - module: google_workspace
  saml:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  user_accounts:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  login:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  admin:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  drive:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"
  groups:
    enabled: true
    var.jwt_file: "./credentials_file.json"
    var.delegated_account: "user@example.com"

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  # ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
  output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true

  # ================================= Processors =================================
  processors:
    - add_host_metadata:
        when.not.contains.tags: forwarded
    - add_cloud_metadata: ~
    - add_docker_metadata: ~
    - add_kubernetes_metadata: ~
  ```
  
  If you're running `Filebeat 7` add this code block to the end. Otherwise, you can leave it out.

  ```yml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...

  - if:
      has_fields: ['gsuite']
    then:
    - rename:
        fields:
        - from: "source"
          to: "gsuite_source"
  - rename:
      fields:
      - from: "agent"
        to: "filebeat_agent"
      ignore_missing: true
  - rename:
      fields:
      - from: "log.file.path"
        to: "source"
      ignore_missing: true
  - add_id: ~

  filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
  ```

  __Validate your YAML__

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, 
  clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Validate configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start filebeat

  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="filebeat" source="Google_Cloud_Workspace" />
