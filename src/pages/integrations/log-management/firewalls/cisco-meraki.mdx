Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that enables you to send your Cisco Meraki 
logs to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined 
examples below to start sending and analysing your Meraki logs.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Configure Syslog Server

  Configure your Cisco Meraki to write all logs to a single file and to send logs to a Syslog server.

  View [more details](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/Syslog_Server_Overview_and_Configuration) on 
  how to configure Meraki Syslog.

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Locate the configuration file

  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        <EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/filebeat.yml
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the 
  Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

  ```yml copy showLineNumbers
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
  filebeat.inputs:

  - type: udp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:514"
      enabled: true

      fields:
          type: ciscomeraki
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 12h

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 7__, add this code block to the end. Otherwise, you can leave it out.

  ```yaml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
  filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 6__, add this code block to the end.

  ```yaml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
  registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
  ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to 
  rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Validate Configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="ciscomeraki" source="meraki" />

### Cisco Meraki Logging Overview

Meraki devices generate logs that record various events and activities that occur on the network. 
These logs are used to monitor network performance, troubleshoot issues, and identify security threats.

Here are some common types of logs generated by Meraki devices:

_System Logs_: These logs record system-level events such as device startup, shutdown, and configuration changes.

_Traffic Logs_: These logs record details about network traffic such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

_Security Logs_: These logs record security-related events such as intrusion attempts, malware detections, and VPN connections.

_Wireless Logs_: These logs record wireless-specific events such as client associations, disassociations, and authentication failures.

_Switch Logs_: These logs record switch-specific events such as port status changes, VLAN assignments, and link failures.

Meraki devices provide real-time visibility into network activity through the dashboard, 
which can be used to search and filter logs based on various criteria such as time 
range, device, event type, and severity. The logs can also be exported for further analysis 
or integration with third-party tools.
