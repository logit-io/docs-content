Configure a Fortigate firewall to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

  ### Install Filebeat

  ### Configure Fortigate Logging

  __Configure the Fortigate firewall to log to a syslog server:__

  You can configure the Fortigate firewall to log to a syslog server through the 
  web interface or through the CLI. To configure through the web interface, 
  go to "System" -> "Log & Report" -> "Syslog". 

  From there, you can add a new syslog server and specify the IP address or 
  hostname of the machine running Filebeat.

  * Log format: syslog
  * Send over: UDP
  * IP Address: Your Filebeat server IP address
  * Port: 514

  __To configure through the CLI, run the following commands:__

  ```cmd copy
  config log syslogd setting
  set status enable
  set format default
  set server <Filebeat_machine_IP_Address>
  set port 514
  end
  ```

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

  ```yml copy
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
  filebeat.inputs:

  - type: udp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:514"
      enabled: true

      fields:
          type: fortigate
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 12h

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 7__, add this code block to the end. Otherwise, you can leave it out.

  ```yaml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
  filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 6__, add this code block to the end.

  ```yaml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
  registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
  ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
  file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

## Fortigate Overview

FortiGate firewalls provide advanced network security features for enterprise environments, protecting against 
cyber threats and unauthorized access. To effectively monitor and analyze network activity, it is essential to 
have a reliable and efficient log management solution. Filebeat, a popular open-source shipping tool, is widely 
used to send logs from FortiGate firewalls to various destinations, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, 
due to its reliability and minimal memory footprint.

Filebeat, which is written in Go, combines key features from Logstash-Forwarder and Lumberjack to generate, parse, 
tail, and forward common logs within the logging pipeline to be indexed within Elasticsearch. Filebeat is the most 
popular way to send logs to ELK, out of the entire collection of open-source shipping tools, including Auditbeat, 
Metricbeat, and Heartbeat. Earlier versions of Filebeat only allowed users to send events to Logstash and Elasticsearch, 
but recent updates to the shipper have made it compatible with [Redis](/integrations/log-management/applications/redis) & 
[Kafka](/integrations/log-management/message-queues/kafka).

Sending logs from FortiGate firewalls to Filebeat is a simple process that involves configuring the firewall to forward 
logs to a syslog server. Once the logs are received by the syslog server, Filebeat can be used to collect and forward 
log data to Elasticsearch or other destinations.

Filebeat provides a filebeat.yml wizard that helps users avoid complex logging concerns, such as large registry files 
and frequent errors encountered when handling deleted or renamed log files. Users can also consider our Hosted ELK 
service to simplify tracking numerous pipelines using this shipper.

In summary, Filebeat is an essential tool for efficiently managing log data from FortiGate firewalls. Its reliability, 
minimal memory footprint, and compatibility with various destinations make it a popular choice for many organizations. 
To ensure effective log management and analysis, users should consider configuring FortiGate firewalls to forward logs 
to Filebeat and taking advantage of the shipper's advanced features.
