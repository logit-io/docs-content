Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that enables you to send your Cisco Firepower 
logs to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined 
examples below to start sending and analysing your Firepower logs.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
    ### Install Filebeat

    <InstallFilebeat />

    ### Locate the configuration file

    <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        <EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/filebeat.yml
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### Configure Filebeat.yml

    The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.

    Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

    ```yml copy
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs: 
    - type: udp
    max_message_size: 10MiB
    host: "0.0.0.0:514"
    enabled: true

    fields:
        type: ciscofirepower
    fields_under_root: true
    encoding: utf-8
    ignore_older: 12h
    
    # ================================== Outputs ===================================
    output.logstash:
        hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
        loadbalance: true
        ssl.enabled: true
    ```

    If you're running __Filebeat 7__, add this code block to the end. Otherwise, you can leave it out.

    ```yaml copy
    # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
    filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
    ```

    If you're running __Filebeat 6__, add this code block to the end.

    ```yaml copy
    # ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
    registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
    ```

    _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your YAML 
    file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

    ### Validate Configuration

    <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

    ### Configure Firepower Syslog server

    You can now go ahead and configure your Cisco Firepower Firewall to write all logs to the configured agent address (syslog endpoint) you have configured.

    configure Cisco Firepower Syslog.

    ### How to diagnose no data in Stack
