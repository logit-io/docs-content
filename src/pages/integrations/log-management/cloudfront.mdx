<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide 
  from Amazon will help you achieve this if you are not doing so already:
        
  [Cloudwatch to S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/S3ExportTasksConsole.html).

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
        
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear:

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "SidID",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
  }
  ```
