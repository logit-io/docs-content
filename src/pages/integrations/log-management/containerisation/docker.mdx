Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that enables you to send your 
Docker container application logs to your Logit.io Stack. 
Configure [Filebeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/filebeat) using the pre-defined 
examples below to start sending and analysing your Docker application logs.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Filebeat

  <FilebeatContainer>
    ```yaml copy
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs:

    - type: container

      enabled: true

      paths:
      - 'var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log'

    # ================================== Outputs ===================================
    output.logstash:
        hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
        loadbalance: true
        ssl.enabled: true
    ```
  </FilebeatContainer>

  ### Validate configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

### Docker Logging Overview
Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS) tool created for building & deploying applications 
by using containers. Developers use these isolated containers to package an application 
with all of its required dependencies for streamlined deployment. 
Docker was first created in 2013 and offers both a free open source solution and paid offering. 
The platform has been instrumental in the development of cloud-native applications.

Thanks to Docker's widespread adoption, the trend towards using microservices and containerization 
has become a must for developers launching applications in the cloud.

Despite this, effective log analysis using Docker's container logs can easily spiral and run 
into many complications when trying to keep up with the scaling required for your growing infrastructure. 
Due to their isolated & distributed nature, centralising Docker log messages is often overly 
problematic when log data is required for further analysis.

The Logit.io platform provides a single source of truth for container monitoring and log management. 
We enable your teams to have complete observability across containers, enabling your 
Developers & IT leaders with the ability to investigate and fix issues faster.

### Docker Logging FAQ

#### How can a custom Filebeat configuration be embedded in a Docker image?

You can embed a custom Filebeat configuration in a Docker image by 
creating a custom Dockerfile. First, you need to start with the base Filebeat image. 
Then, copy your custom Filebeat configuration file (e.g., filebeat.yml) to the 
appropriate directory inside the Docker image. When you build the Docker image using this Dockerfile, 
the custom Filebeat configuration will be included within the image. This allows you to 
package Filebeat with your specific configuration settings directly into a Docker image.

#### How can Filebeat be configured via volume mount on Docker?

Filebeat can be configured on Docker by utilizing volume mounts. One approach is to 
provide the filebeat.docker.yml file via a volume mount. When running Docker with Filebeat, 
the volume mount is specified by including specific paths to map files and directories 
between the host machine and the Docker container.

By using the `--volume` flag in the `docker run` command, various volumes can be mounted. 
In the case of Filebeat configuration, you may want to mount the filebeat.docker.yml file 
to the appropriate path within the Filebeat container so that it can read the configuration. 
Additionally, it is common to mount directories such as `/var/lib/docker/containers` and 
`/var/run/docker.sock` to access Docker-related data.

Each specified volume mount should include the source path on the host machine followed 
by a colon and the destination path within the container. Permissions for mounts can also 
be set, such as read-only access using `:ro` or read-write access with `:rw`.
