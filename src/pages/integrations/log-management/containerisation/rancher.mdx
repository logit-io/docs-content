Start analysing Rancher logs by following our easy configuration 
guide to ship logs to Logstash for centralised Rancher logging and analysis

<Steps>
  ### Deprecation

  Since Rancher have deprecated their internal Logging solution we will be using filebeat instead

  ![Deprecation notice](@/images/integrations/rancher/deprecation.png)

  ### Download Manifest

  Download the filebeat Kubernetes deploy manifest using the link below:

  [Click to download filebeat-kubernetes.yaml](https://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml)

  ### Insert Stack Details

  <InsertStackDetails>
    Open the manifest and around line 57 you should see the environment variables 
    controlling the logging destination. You need to update them to point to your stack.
  </InsertStackDetails>

  ### Deploy

  Select the cluster you wish to collect logs from.

  Go to Resources -> Workloads. Click 'Import YAML' from the top right menu

  Set the Import Mode to Cluster and paste in the YAML file you edited in step 3

  ![Paste YAML file into editor](@/images/integrations/rancher/step4.png)

  Click Import

  ### Confirm

  You should see a filebeat workload deploying in the kube-system namespace in 
  the System project. Once this has completed logs should start arriving in your stack.

  If you do not see any log messages, you should start by checking the filebeat logs for any error messages

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

### Rancher Logs Overview

Rancher is a popular open-source software used by teams that wish to manage 
multiple [Kubernetes](/integrations/logs/containerisation/kubernetes) clusters 
across complex infrastructures. Rancher adds significant value to Kubernetes 
by providing a solution to the security challenges encountered when 
running containerized workloads at scale. 

You may have recently seen that the company that created Rancher, Rancher Labs 
were acquired by SUSE & as a result of this acquisition have become one of 
the world's biggest companies powering digital transformation.

If you don't have centralized logging for managing your Rancher-server logs it 
can be difficult to [tail logs](https://logit.io/solutions/live-tail-hosted-logtrail/) 
reliability. As your container base grows in size they'll often become a lot more 
complicated to troubleshoot efficiently. Without the addition of a monitoring solution, 
identifying errors proactively & setting alerts on predefined conditions can 
be hard to implement as your business grows in size.

Our built in HA (high availability) Rancher log file analyser can be used 
alongside our container monitoring solution to monitor your server, debug 
& metric logs. Allow your teams to easily alert & identify issues within 
your Rancher environment for further processing. With Logit.io you'll 
also enable your DevOps team to easily include this data as part of 
your reporting with our Kibana based visualisations.
