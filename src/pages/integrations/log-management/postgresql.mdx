      There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the postgresql module:

      ```cmd copy
      .\filebeat.exe modules list
      .\filebeat.exe modules enable postgresql
      ```
      In the module config under modules.d, change the module settings to match your environment. You must enable at least one fileset in the module. 
      
      ___Filesets are disabled by default___.

      Copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the postgresql.yml module file:

      ```cmd copy
      # Module: postgresql
      # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12/filebeat-module-postgresql.html

      - module: postgresql
      # All logs
      log:
          enabled: true

          # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
          # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
          #var.paths:
      ```

### PostgreSQL Logging Overview

PostgreSQL (often shortened to Postgres) is a highly stable open-source relational database 
that supports both relational & non-relational querying. Postgres can run across the majority 
of operating systems including Linux, [Windows](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/windows) 
and [macOS](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/macos).

PostgreSQL is used by some of the world's best known brands including Apple, IMDB, Red Hat & Cisco 
due to its robust feature set, useful addons & scalability. 

Some of the benefits of using this database include their support for the majority of programming 
languages as well as it's strengths as a reliable transactional database for companies of all sizes.

PostgreSQL users are encouraged to log as much as possible as with insufficient configuration you could 
easily lose access to key messages for troubleshooting and error resolution. Below are some of the most 
important logs you'll likely need to analyse when running Postgres.

PostgreSQL transaction logs help the user to identify what queries a transaction encountered.

Remote Host IP/Name (w/ port) logs can serve to help security technicians identify suspicious activity 
that has occurred. If you are looking to pinpoint troublesome sessions affecting your infrastructure 
you might turn to Process ID logs for further insights.

When it comes to logging in Postgres there are twenty three other parameters which can be isolated for 
troubleshooting using the various keywords; ERROR, FATAL, WARNING, & PANIC.

With all these logs, directories & parameters it is easy to become overwhelmed at the prospect of having 
to thoroughly analyse your log data & you may wish to use a 
[log management system](https://logit.io/platform/logging/log-management) to streamline your processes. 

Our built in PostgreSQL log file analyser helps DBAs, sysadmins, and developers identify issues, create 
visualisations & set alerts when preconfigured and custom parameters are met.

If you need any assistance with analysing your PostgreSQL logs we're here to help.
