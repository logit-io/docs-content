Journalbeat is a lightweight, open source shipping agent that lets you ship log data from systemd journals stored on Linux operating systems to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

Please note that this beat is currently in an **experimental** phase and may be changed or removed in the future. This guide uses version 7.9.3 of Journalbeat and has been tested using Ubuntu.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Journalbeat

  Journalbeat is intended for Linux operating systems. Therefore, no versions of journalbeat exists for Windows or MacOS.

  The following curl commands will get version 7.9.3 of journalbeat but you can get the latest version using more 
  specialised package managers specific to the OS being used, or by downloading the package manually.

  <Tabs items={["DEB", "RPM"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```ps1 copy
    curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/journalbeat/journalbeat-7.9.3-amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i journalbeat-7.9.3-amd64.deb
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```ps1 copy
    curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/journalbeat/journalbeat-7.9.3-x86_64.rpm
    sudo rpm -vi journalbeat-7.9.3-x86_64.rpm
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure Journalbeat

Locate and open the journalbeat configuration file:
        
```ps1 copy
/etc/journalbeat/journalbeat.yml
````

The following example will send all local journal log data to Logstash. By specifying an empty array as the paths value, the default `/var/log/` 
path value will be used to point to the directory containing all locally persisted journals. This is a sensible default but you can specify 
other paths to files or directories for journalbeat to crawl if required.

```yaml copy
journalbeat.inputs:
  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched (can be files or directories).
  # When setting a directory, all journals under it are merged.
  # When empty starts to read from local journal.
  paths: []
```

<Callout type="info">
    A full example configuration file called journalbeat.reference.yml shows all possible configuration options.
</Callout>

### Configure Output

  <Output>
    We'll be shipping to Logstash so that we have the option to run filters before the data is indexed.  
    Comment out the elasticsearch output block.

    ```yaml copy
    ## Comment out elasticsearch output
    #output.elasticsearch:
    #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    ```
  </Output>

### Validate Configuration

<Tabs items={["DEB/RPM"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```ps1 copy
    sudo journalbeat -e -c /etc/journalbeat/journalbeat.yml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Start Journalbeat

Ok, time to start ingesting data!

<Tabs items={["DEB/RPM"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```ps1 copy
    sudo systemctl enable journalbeat
    sudo systemctl start journalbeat
    ```
  </Tab>

### Journalbeat Overview

Journalbeat is a recent addition to Elastic's Beats family that collects log entries from Systemd Journals. Journalbeat is based on the libbeat 
framework. Journalbeat is forecast to be repurposed from being a Beat and will instead become a module for 
[Filebeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/filebeat) in the near future.

Journalbeat monitors the journal locations that are specified and also collects logs for forwarding with Logstash and further processing in 
Elasticsearch. It is rated as being easier to use than more commonly known Beats (such as Filebeat), but is noted as an experimental Beat by Elastic 
so is subject to change.

Journalbeat can be used to ship logs from [Kubernetes](/integrations/log-management/containerisation/kubernetes) but some users may not see their data being 
reflected in Elasticsearch and may prefer to use Filebeat or [Fluentd](/integrations/log-management/shippers/fluentd) for a seamless and wider community 
supported logging experience.

If you require any more assistance in using Journalbeat or any other Elastic Beats for shipping your log events we're here to help. Feel free to reach
