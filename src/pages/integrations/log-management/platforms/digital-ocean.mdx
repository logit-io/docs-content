  ### Log Forwarding on DigitalOcean

  This guide explains how to forward logs from DigitalOcean's App Platform 
  to Logit.io. Integrating DigitalOcean with Logit.io optimizes log management 
  and enhances the monitoring of your application's performance and security.
      
  Forwarding logs to Logit.io enables real-time log aggregation, search, 
  and alerts, facilitating efficient troubleshooting and analysis.

  ### Setting Up DigitalOcean for Log Forwarding to Logit.io

  Begin by configuring your [DigitalOcean account for log forwarding](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/forward-logs/). 
  You will set up a forwarding destination that routes logs to your Logit.io stack.

  To forward logs from the DigitalOcean App Platform to Logit.io, follow these steps:

  - Navigate to the [App Platform dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps) in your DigitalOcean account.
  - Select the app you wish to configure log forwarding for.
  - Go to the "Settings" tab and find the "Log Forwarding" section.
  - From the list of log forwarders, select "Papertrail" as your forwarding option and enter your Logit.io Endpoint.

  ```cmd copy
  @logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort
  ```

  - Save the changes.

  Your application logs will now be automatically forwarded to Logit.io.
