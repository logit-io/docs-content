## Wazuh Overview

Wazuh is a free, open-source security monitoring solution that provides 
comprehensive threat detection, integrity monitoring, and compliance 
management capabilities. It is designed to help organizations detect 
and respond to security incidents in real-time and maintain 
compliance with various industry regulations and standards.

To effectively monitor and analyze security events, it is essential to 
have a reliable and efficient log management solution. Wazuh leverages 
the Elastic Stack, which includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and OpenSearch, 
to provide a centralized platform for collecting, processing, 
and visualizing security-related data.

To send data from Wazuh to Logstash, organizations can use Filebeat, an 
open-source log shipper. Filebeat can be configured to monitor the Wazuh 
logs directory and send any new logs to Logstash, where they can be 
processed and analyzed for real-time threat detection and response.

In summary, using Wazuh as a security monitoring solution provides 
organizations with a reliable and efficient way to detect and respond to 
security incidents in real-time and maintain compliance with industry 
regulations and standards. By leveraging the Elastic Stack and various 
agents and modules, organizations can collect and analyze data from 
various sources and gain valuable insights into their security posture.
