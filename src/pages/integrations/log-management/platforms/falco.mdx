Configure Falco to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Falco Logging

  Falco serves as a container security and threat detection engine for Kubernetes at runtime, 
  that detects unauthorized container activity and logs it. Falco has been approved 
  by the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) for this purpose.

  __Set the output format to JSON__

  - Locate the configuration file, which is typically named `/etc/falco/falco.yaml`.
  - Open the configuration file with a text editor of your choice.
  - Ensure `json_output: true` and `json_include_output_property: true`
  - Save the changes to the configuration file.
  - Restart the Falco service to apply the updated configuration.

  __Look up the filepath to Falco's logs__

  - In the same configuration file `/etc/falco/falco.yaml`
  - Under `file_output:` make a note of the `filename:` value, this will be used in step 3 to configure Filebeat.

  It's important to review the Falco [documentation](https://falco.org/docs/) for any 
  specific guidance or instructions if you need to customise how logging is configured.

## Falco Overview

Falco is a free, open-source container security monitoring solution that provides 
real-time threat detection and response capabilities. It is designed to help 
organizations identify and respond to security incidents in containerized environments.

To effectively monitor and analyze security events in containerized environments, 
it is essential to have a reliable and efficient log management solution. Falco provides 
a centralized platform for collecting, processing, and visualizing security-related 
data in real-time. It can be used to monitor various activities in container environments, 
such as network connections, file system access, and process execution.

To send data from Falco to other systems or services, organizations can use various 
output options, including JSON logs, Syslog, and gRPC. For instance, to output JSON 
logs to a file, users can modify the Falco configuration file and add the necessary output configuration.

In summary, using Falco as a container security monitoring solution provides organizations 
with a reliable and efficient way to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time. 
By leveraging the output options and various agents and modules, organizations can collect 
and analyze data from container environments and gain valuable insights into their security posture.
