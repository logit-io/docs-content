Configure Zeek to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Zeek Logging

  Depending on the version of Zeek or Bro (Zeek's predecessor) you are running, 
  the configuration filepath may vary. If you need assistance in locating the file, 
  refer to your [installation's documentation](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/).

  For Bro, the configuration file should be named `ascii.bro` or if you are 
  using Zeek, the filename will be `ascii.zeek`.

  Once you have located the configuration file, you need to find the line that 
  starts with `const use_json`. Set the value of this line to true (T) 
  to enable the use of JSON format for output.

  ```js copy
  const use_json = T
  ```

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  <FilebeatFilestream type="zeek" path="/var/log/bro/current/dns.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/dpd.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/http.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/rdp.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/smb.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/ssh.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/ssl.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/conn.log\n  - /var/log/bro/current/notice.log" />

  ### Validate configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start Filebeat

  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="Zeek" source="zeek" />

## Zeek Overview

Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is a free, open-source network security monitoring 
solution that provides comprehensive threat detection and analysis capabilities. 
To effectively monitor and analyze security events, it's essential to have a 
reliable and efficient log management solution. Zeek can be configured to 
generate logs in various formats, including ASCII and JSON, depending on the desired output.

To send Zeek logs to Logstash for processing and analysis, organizations can 
use Filebeat, an open-source log shipper. Filebeat can be configured to monitor 
the Zeek logs directory and send any new logs to Logstash, where they can be 
processed and analyzed for real-time threat detection and response.

The configuration file path and filename for Zeek may vary depending on the specific 
installation and version. You can refer to your installation's documentation to find 
the location of the configuration file. In the configuration file, you need to set 
the "LogAscii::use_json" variable to "T" (true) to generate logs in JSON format.

Once the logs are generated in the desired format, Filebeat can be used to securely 
transfer them to Logstash for processing and analysis. Logstash can leverage various 
plugins and modules to filter, transform, and enhance the data, enabling advanced 
correlation and analysis to identify potential security threats.

Using Zeek with Filebeat and Logstash provides organizations with a powerful network 
security monitoring solution that can detect and respond to security incidents in 
real-time, while also maintaining compliance with industry regulations and standards. 
By leveraging various agents and modules, organizations can collect and analyze data 
from various sources, gain valuable insights into their network security posture, 
and make informed decisions to improve their overall security stance.
