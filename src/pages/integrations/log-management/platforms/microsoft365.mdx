Configure Microsoft 365 to ship logs via Filebeat to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Configure Microsoft 365 Logging

  By deploying this integration, you can forward Unified Audit Logging logs 
  from Microsoft 365 to Logit.io using the Microsoft 365 Management API. 
  This approach currently supports several Microsoft 365 content types, including:

  - "Audit.AzureActiveDirectory"
  - "Audit.Exchange"
  - "Audit.SharePoint"
  - "Audit.General"
  - "DLP.All"

  To utilize this integration, you'll need an active Microsoft 365 subscription 
  with an administrator account that has the appropriate provisioning. 
  
  Additionally, [Unified Audit Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-log-enable-disable?view=o365-worldwide#verify-the-auditing-status-for-your-organization) 
  must be enabled within Microsoft 365's Security and Audit Center.

  ### Register a new application in Azure AD

  - Sign in to the portal.zure.com and navigate to the Azure Active Directory service.
  - Select __"App registrations"__ and click __"New registration."__
  - Enter a name for the application and select the appropriate account type and redirect URI.

  <Callout type="info">
    Make sure to take note of the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) 
    ID as they will be required for configuring Filebeat at a later step.
  </Callout>

  ### Create a client secret for your application

  - Select __"App registrations"__ and click on the application that we created in step 2.
  - Go to the __"Certificates & secrets"__ page and click __"New client secret."__
  - Enter a description for the client secret and choose an expiration option.
  - Click __"Add"__ to create the client secret and copy the value as it will not be displayed again.
  - Store the client secret value securely, as it cannot be retrieved later.
  - Go to the __"API permissions"__ on the left hand side and click __"Add a permission."__
  - On the __"Application permissions"__ tab, activate the __"ActivityFeed.Read"__ and __"ActivityFeed.ReadDlp"__ permissions.

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Filebeat

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat 
  module file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/modules.d/o365.yml.disabled`
        
  Save the file as `o365.yml`.

```yml copy showLineNumbers
# Module: o365
# Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.6/filebeat-module-o365.html

- module: o365
  audit:
    enabled: true

    # Set the application_id (also known as client ID):
    var.application_id: <ApplicationID>

    # Configure the tenants to monitor:
    # Use the tenant ID (also known as directory ID) and the domain name.
    # var.tenants:
    #  - id: "tenant_id_1"
    #    name: "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
    #  - id: "tenant_id_2"
    #    name: "mycompany.com"
    var.tenants:
      - id: <TenantID>
        name: <TenantName>

    # List of content-types to fetch. By default all known content-types
    # are retrieved:
    # var.content_type:
    #  - "Audit.AzureActiveDirectory"
    #  - "Audit.Exchange"
    #  - "Audit.SharePoint"
    #  - "Audit.General"
    #  - "DLP.All"

    # Use the following settings to enable certificate-based authentication:
    # var.certificate: "/path/to/certificate.pem"
    # var.key: "/path/to/private_key.pem"
    # var.key_passphrase: "myPrivateKeyPassword"

    # Client-secret based authentication:
    # Comment the following line if using certificate authentication.
    var.client_secret: "<ClientSecret>"

    # Advanced settings, use with care:
    # var.api:
    #   # Settings for custom endpoints:
    #   authentication_endpoint: "https://login.microsoftonline.us/"
    #   resource: "https://manage.office365.us"
    #
    #   max_retention: 168h
    #   max_requests_per_minute: 2000
    #   poll_interval: 3m
```

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat 
  configuration `Inputs` section, the file is typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`
  
  ```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
  filebeat.config:
    modules:
      enabled: true            
      path: modules.d/*.yml

    fields:
        type: o365
    fields_under_root: true
  
  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
    loadbalance: true
    ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  _It's a good idea to run the configuration file through a YAML 
  validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, 
  and check if your YAML file is valid. [Yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com) is a great choice._

  ### Validate configuration
  
  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="M365" source="Microsoft_365" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

## Microsoft 365 Overview

Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based productivity suite that includes a range of 
services such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams. 
To ensure the security of these services, it's important to have a 
robust monitoring solution in place.

One way to monitor Microsoft 365 activity is by leveraging its auditing 
capabilities. This allows organizations to track user activity and identify 
potential security threats in real-time. To make sense of the audit logs, 
it's essential to have a reliable log management solution that can 
collect, process, and analyze the data.

One way to achieve this is by using Filebeat to ship Microsoft 365 logs to 
Logstash and OpenSearch. This process involves creating a new application 
registration in Azure AD and granting it appropriate permissions to access 
the Microsoft 365 Management API. A client secret is then created for the 
application, and the Application (client) ID and 
Directory (tenant) ID are noted down.

With Microsoft 365 and Filebeat, organizations can proactively monitor user 
activity, detect potential security incidents, and ensure compliance with 
industry regulations and standards. By collecting and analyzing data from 
various sources, organizations can gain valuable insights into their security 
posture and take appropriate measures to safeguard their environment.
