  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide from Amazon will 
  help you achieve this if you are not doing this already, you can choose the best way 
  to achieve this, but cloudwatch or cloudtrail are a great place to start:

  [VPC Flow Logs Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html)

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
  
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear:

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "SidID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
