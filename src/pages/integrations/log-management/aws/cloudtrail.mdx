<Steps>
  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide from 
  Amazon will help you achieve this if you are not doing this already:
        
  [Cloudtrail to S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.htm).

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
        
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear:

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "SidID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ### Configure Logstash for Amazon Cloudtrail

  <AddS3Input type="aws_cloudtrail" utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="awscloudtrail" />

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack source="cloudtrail" utmMedium="aws" utmCampaign="cloudtrail" />
</Steps>

## Cloudtrail Logging Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from CloudTrail is an efficient process that ensures your AWS infrastructure 
remains secure and your logs are easily accessible for analysis. By configuring CloudTrail to forward 
logs to Logit.io, you can gain deeper insights into your AWS environment, troubleshoot issues, and 
proactively detect and respond to security incidents. 

This approach complements the use of [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](/integrations/metrics/aws/aws-eks-metrics) 
for container orchestration, as well as the efficient utilization of 
[AWS Lambda](/integrations/log-management/aws/aws-cloudwatch-lambda) for comprehensive log management. 

As part of Logit.io's service for [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/), these integrations all work together in tandem.
