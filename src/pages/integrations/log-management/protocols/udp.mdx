  ### Recommendations

  Logs sent via UDP are **not encrypted** and have **no delivery guarantee**.

  This input is supported for legacy reasons and Logit.io would not recommend setting up a new source integration sending via UDP if there is a better option available.

  ### Send data to UDP input

  <SendDataToUDP />

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="udp" source="udp" />

### UDP Logging Overview

UDP (or User Datagram Protocol) is a communication transport protocol used across the Internet for a range of transmission types, including 
video playback or DNS lookups.

As this protocol doesn't require a “handshake”, it makes initial data transfer a lot faster but also creates a gateway that could be easily 
exploited.

Because of the lack of handshake, there are no guarantees that your data will be delivered successfully and won't be duplicated.
Users that require error correction facilities may prefer to use  <a href="/integrations/log-management/protocols/tcp" target="_blank">TCP</a> 
instead of UDP to remedy the concerns cited above.

Our UDP log file analyser can be used to view, manage and centralise your log messages as well as deliver metrics for detailed and dynamically 
updating Kibana visualisations.

If you need any assistance with analysing your UDP log data we're here to help. Feel free to reach out by contacting the Logit.io support team
