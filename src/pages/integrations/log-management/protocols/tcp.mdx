### TCP Logging Overview

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that 
defines how to establish a network conversation for applications to exchange 
data & works with IPs to define how networks send packets of data.

TCP logs can be used to collect errors & exceptions being thrown as well as 
logging user activity metrics. These insights can be hard to analyse at scale 
through the use of distributed visualisation, parsing & analysis tools. 

The Logit.io platform is built to enable you to drive data-driven insights 
from your TCP/IP data logs & bring together TCP & [UDP](/integrations/log-management/protocols/udp) for 
full observability on your application's performance in one centralised location. 

Logit.io enables your Dev teams to alert and notify any errors detected in your TCP log files. 

Logit.io can also be used as TCP [log viewer](https://logit.io/solutions/log-viewer/) as 
our integrated Kibana dashboards make light work at processing data at speed. 
Our platform also has live tailing enabled for real-time insights on your application activity.

If you need any more help with migrating your TCP logs to Logstash the 
Logit.io team are here to help. Feel free to reach out by contacting our 
support team <IntercomButton text="via live chat" /> & we'll be happy to assist.
