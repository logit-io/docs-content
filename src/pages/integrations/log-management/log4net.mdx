Send your log4net application/access/error logs to Logit.io via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install

  Installing log4net and Logit.io appender.

  ```ps copy
  Install-Package log4net
  Install-Package log4net.Logit
  ```

  ### Configuring log4net

  Configuring log4net can be done in your application `app.config` or `web.config` or specific log4net configuration file.
  
  ```xml copy showLineNumbers
  <appender name="LogitAppender" type="log4net.Logit.LogitAppender, log4net.Logit">
    <apikey value="@apikey" />
    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
      <conversionpattern value="%property{log4net:HostName} %-5p %d %5rms %-22.22c{1} %-18.18M - %m%n" />
    </layout>
  </appender>
  
  <root>
    <level value="ALL" />
    <appender-ref ref="LogitAppender" />
  </root>
  ```
       
  log4net is a fully featured logging framework and has many other capabilities that are not 
  detailed here, please see the [log4net Documentation](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/) for more information.

## Log4Net Logger Overview

Log4net is a logging platform & framework for [.NET](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/dotnet) that uses 
hierarchical logging. This allows users to selectively control which log messages are sent to a 
particular output target so as to not overwhelm the system.

Log4net is often mentioned in association with [Serilog](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/serilog) & 
[NLog](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/nlog) as all three provide frameworks suitable for shipping 
data from .Net to an external log management service.

This framework is built to prioritise speed and flexibility for the user and also 
features fail-stop & thread-safe functionality. 

As of April of this year, the project is regarded as dormant due to the lack of active 
users performing code reviews, committing new code or launching new releases of Log4net.

While Log4net itself is a logging framework, it also creates internal logs of its own 
that users find tedious to reliably troubleshoot without the use of a tool like 
[Hosted Logstash](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-logstash/). 

The Logit.io platform is home to both a Log4net & .NET log file analyzer 
built on Hosted Logstash, Elasticsearch & Kibana to make centralising 
your data & setting up alerts to monitor your applications easy.

If you need any assistance with analysing your internal Log4net or .NET 
logs we're here to help. Feel free to reach out by contacting us

you get started with analysing your data.
