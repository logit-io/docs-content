### Azure Log Monitoring Overview

As a disaster recovery tool, Azure is known for its advanced site recovery 
which is operational across all operating systems, locations, & languages. 
The platform also allows users to customise the frequency of backup schedules 
& works alongside the Logit.io platform as our hosted ELK Stacks support 
version control & rollbacks for added peace of mind.

Our platform is built to 
simplify [Azure log management](https://logit.io/solutions/azure-logging) as 
we provide your [hybrid cloud & multi-cloud](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/cloud-monitoring) Azure 
environments with the ability to parse & monitor your activity across 
hybrid environments & audit logs to bring data-driven insights that 
are valuable for a wide variety of use cases.

Logit.io's hosted Elastic Stack allows you to aggregate and analyze 
all of your logs centrally, saving your InfoSec & DevOps teams from 
unnecessary maintenance overheads by centralising all of your Azure monitor logs.

Tail large volumes of logs & gain near real-time insights on the performance 
and security issues your infrastructure faces using our cloud-based platform. 
Logit.io also offers automated parsing through highly available Logstash 
pipelines as a solution for migrating your log data fast.

If you need any further assistance with migrating your Azure data to 
Logstash we're here to help you discover the insights locked in data hosted on 
Azure, [GCP](/integrations/log-management/google-cloud/operations), AWS or any
