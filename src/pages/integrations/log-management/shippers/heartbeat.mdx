Heartbeat is a lightweight shipping agent used to monitor the health of services running on the host. 
The results can then be shipped to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Heartbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="heartbeat" />

  ### Locate the configuration file

  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      /etc/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      <EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/heartbeat.yml
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  
  ### Configure the monitors
 
  The following example shows a basic configuration for each of the three different types of monitors, ICMP, TCP, and HTTP.
        
  Copy the contents below and paste this into the heartbeat.yml file at line 39

  ```yaml copy
  # Configure monitors inline
  heartbeat.monitors:
  - type: http
    # Set enabled to true (or delete the following line) to enable this monitor
    enabled: true
    # ID used to uniquely identify this monitor in Elasticsearch even if the config changes
    id: my-monitor
    # Human readable display name for this service in Uptime UI and elsewhere
    name: My Monitor
    # List of URLs to query
    urls: ["https://logit.io"]
    # Configure task schedule
    schedule: '@every 10s'

  # Other examples for icmp, tcp and http
  # heartbeat.monitors:
  # - type: icmp
  #   schedule: '@every 5s'
  #   hosts: ["myhost"]
  # - type: tcp
  #   schedule: '@every 5s'
  #   hosts: ["myhost:7"]  # default TCP Echo Protocol
  #   check.send: "Check"
  #   check.receive: "Check"
  # - type: http
  #   schedule: '@every 5s'
  #   urls: ["http://localhost:80/service/status"]
  #   check.response.status: 200
  # heartbeat.scheduler:
  #   limit: 10
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
      There's also a full example configuration file called heartbeat.reference.yml that shows all the possible options.
  </Callout>

  ### Configure Output
  
  <Output>
    We'll be shipping to Logstash so that we have the option to run filters before the data is indexed.  
    Comment out the elasticsearch output block.

    ```yaml copy
    ## Comment out elasticsearch output
    #output.elasticsearch:
    #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    ```
  </Output>

        sudo systemctl enable heartbeat
        sudo systemctl start heartbeat
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      sudo chown root heartbeat.yml 
      sudo chown root modules.d/{modulename}.yml 
      sudo ./heartbeat -e
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      Start-Service heartbeat
      ```
    </Tab>

### Heartbeat Logging Overview

Heartbeat is a lightweight shipping agent created by Elastic as part of their Beats group of log shippers. Compared to other tools in 
the Beats family, such as [Metricbeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/metricbeat) & [Winlogbeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/winlogbeat), 
Heartbeat is a relatively new addition to the Elastic Stack.

Heartbeat is the only member of the Beats family that Elastic recommends you to install on a separate network/machine to the one you are currently 
wishing to monitor.

Heartbeat was created to allow observability of the health of services running on the host (this includes uptime monitoring functionality as standard). 
These results can then be shipped to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

Heartbeat supports [HTTP](/integrations/log-management/protocols/http), ICMP and [TCP](/integrations/log-management/protocols/tcp) protocols for monitoring 
service availability. 

If you need to keep a close eye on uptime for the purposes of complying with your company's service level agreement (SLA) then you'll find that Heartbeat 
is integral for monitoring these instances based on the URLs & metrics you supply to the application, prior to indexing. This feedback can be triggered 
based on the custom schedule you select during configuration.

If you need any further assistance with migrating your Heartbeat data to Logstash we're here to help you get started. Feel free
