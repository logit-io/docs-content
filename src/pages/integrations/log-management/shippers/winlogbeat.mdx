Winlogbeat is a Windows specific event-log shipping agent installed as a Windows service. It can be used to collect and send 
event logs to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Winlogbeat

  <InstallWindowsBeat
    beatname = "winlogbeat"
    version = "8.12.2"
  />

  ### Update Your Configuration File

  <Tabs items={["Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
    The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.

    __Note__: Please make sure the 'hosts' field in the Logstash outputs section is correctly populated. If you are logged into 
    your Logit.io account the 'hosts' field should have been pre-populated with the correct values.
    
    Copy the configuration file below (making the above changes as necessary) and overwrite the contents of ___winlogbeat.yml___. 
    (If you used the installer program to install winlogbeat the ___winlogbeat.yml___ file may not exist so you'll need to create 
    it and add the details below).


    ```yaml copy
    ###################### Logit.io Winlogbeat Configuration ########################

    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Validate Configuration

  Let's check the configuration file is syntactically correct. In powershell (in the directory where Winlogbeat is installed) run the following command:
  
  <Tabs items={["Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
    
    ```ps1 copy
    .\winlogbeat.exe test config -c .\winlogbeat.yml -e
    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Start winlogbeat

  From the PowerShell prompt, (in the directory where winlogbeat was installed) run the following command:

  ```ps1 copy
  Start-Service winlogbeat
  ```

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="winlogbeat" source="winlogbeat" />

### Winlogbeat Installation Instructions Overview

Winlogbeat is a logging agent maintained by Elastic for the purposes of collecting Windows event logs. It is part of the beats family 
that makes up the Elastic Stack. Winlogbeat can read events from any event log channel using the Windows OS.

Windows log data once centralised in the ELK stack can be monitored for anomaly detection & other security-related incidents including 
unauthorised access and backdoor installations. These logs can also deliver metrics to Kibana allowing you to create visualisations & 
[security](https://logit.io/about-us/security) reports easily.
