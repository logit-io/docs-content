### Winlogbeat Installation Instructions Overview

Winlogbeat is a logging agent maintained by Elastic for the purposes of collecting Windows event logs. It is part of the beats family 
that makes up the Elastic Stack. Winlogbeat can read events from any event log channel using the Windows OS.

Windows log data once centralised in the ELK stack can be monitored for anomaly detection & other security-related incidents including 
unauthorised access and backdoor installations. These logs can also deliver metrics to Kibana allowing you to create visualisations & 
[security](https://logit.io/about-us/security) reports easily.
