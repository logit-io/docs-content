Packetbeat is a network package analyser used to capture network traffic. It can be used to extract useful fields of information from network transactions 
before shipping them to one or more destinations, including Logstash. This is useful for troubleshooting and detecting performance hits.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install

  <InstallBeat beatname="packetbeat" />

  ### Locate the configuration file

  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        /etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.yml 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
        ```ps1 copy
        <EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/packetbeat.yml
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  ### Configure Packetbeat

  Packetbeat needs to be configured to select the network interface from which to capture the traffic.

  __On Windows__, you must also download and install a packet sniffing library, such as [Npcap](https://npcap.com), that implements the libpcap interfaces.
  
  Once installed you can then run the following command to list the available network interfaces:

  ```ps1 copy
  PS C:\Program Files\Packetbeat> .\packetbeat.exe devices
  
  0: \Device\NPF_{113535AD-934A-452E-8D5F-3004797DE286} (Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Desktop Adapter)
  ```
  
  __On Linux:__ Packetbeat supports capturing all messages sent or received by the server on which Packetbeat is installed. For this, use any as the device:

  ```yaml copy
  packetbeat.interfaces.device: any
  ```

  __On OS X__, capturing from the any device does not work. You would typically use either lo0 or en0 depending on which traffic you want to capture.
  
  In this example, there is only one network card, with the index 0, installed on the system. If there are multiple network cards, remember the index of the 
  device you want to use for capturing the traffic.
      
  Modify the device line to point to the index of the device:

  ```yaml copy
  packetbeat.interfaces.device: 0
  ```

      There's also a full example configuration file called packetbeat.full.yml that shows all the possible options.
  </Callout>

  ### Configure protocols

   In the protocols section, configure the ports on which Packetbeat can find each protocol. If you use any non-standard ports, add them here. Otherwise, the default values should do just fine.

  ```yaml copy
  packetbeat.protocols.dns:
    ports: [53]
      
    include_authorities: true
    include_additionals: true
      
  packetbeat.protocols.http:
    ports: [80, 8080, 8081, 5000, 8002]
      
  packetbeat.protocols.memcache:
    ports: [11211]
  
  packetbeat.protocols.mysql:
    ports: [3306]
  
  packetbeat.protocols.pgsql:
    ports: [5432]
  
  packetbeat.protocols.redis:
    ports: [6379]
  
  packetbeat.protocols.thrift:
    ports: [9090]
  
  packetbeat.protocols.mongodb:
    ports: [27017]
      
  packetbeat.protocols.cassandra:
    ports: [9042]
  ```

  ### Configure Output

  We will be shipping to Logstash so that we have the option to run filters before the data is indexed.
          
  Comment out the elasticsearch output block.

  ```yml copy
  ## Comment out elasticsearch output
  #output.elasticsearch:
  #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  ```
  <ConfigureOutput />

  ### Start Packetbeat

  Ok, time to start ingesting data!

  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS", "Windows"]} unlink>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      sudo service packetbeat start
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      ./packetbeat -e
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```ps1 copy
      Start-Service packetbeat
      ```
    </Tab>
