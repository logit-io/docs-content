Metricbeat is an open-source shipping agent used to collect and ship 
operating system and service metrics to your Logit.io Stack 
via [Logstash](/integrations/log-management/shippers/logstash).

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallMetricbeat />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Validate Configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="metricbeat" source="metricbeat" />

  ### Configure Modules (Optional)

  The system status module is enabled by default to collect metrics about your server, such as CPU usage, 
  memory usage, network IO metrics, and process statistics.

  There are a range of other modules which can be enabled for Metricbeat, please choose the module from 
  the list below if you wish to know more.

  ### Metricbeat System dashboard

  The Metricbeat System module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### Metricbeat Overview

Metricbeat is a lightweight metrics shipper built using the Libbeat framework. It's origins started from the 
now deprecated Topbeat & it is used for collecting service and system log metrics to be parsed in Logstash 
and used across the rest of the ELK Stack.

Metricbeat makes sending data for server monitoring simpler by aggregating system metrics from a number of 
popular tools including [NGINX](/integrations/log-management/applications/nginx), 
[MySQL](/integrations/log-management/applications/mysql), 
[Apache](/integrations/log-management/applications/apache) & HAProxy. While Metricbeat 
can push log data directly to the Elastic Stack some users may wish to use a buffering service 
such as Redis or [Kafka](/integrations/log-management/message-queues/kafka). 
Metricbeat does much more than simply collect metrics as it can be used to tap 
into a variety of systems and execute a range of enhancements to the log file before shipping the metrics to ELK.

The shipper when paired with Kibana can be used to report on CPU, memory and load metrics. When used in a containerised 
environment with Docker it can be used as a solution for 
[container monitoring](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/container-monitoring/) on the Logit.io platform.
      
Our platform provides a complete hosted ELK solution allowing you to get the best out of Metricbeat in a single 
centralised platform for log and metric analysis. We believe that monitoring metrics plays a crucial role in maintaining 
the health & security of your applications
