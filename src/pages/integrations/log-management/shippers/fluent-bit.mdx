Fluent Bit is an open source data collector which can be used to 
collect event logs from multiple sources. It filters, buffers and 
transforms the data before forwarding to one or more destinations, 
including [Logstash](/integrations/log-management/shippers/logstash).

### Fluent Bit Logging Overview

Fluent Bit often draws comparisons with Logstash as both log collectors share some similarities especially when it comes to 
platform compatibility.

Where these tools differ though can be seen clearly across their configuration difficulty & performance (Logstash is notably 
easier to configure).

Fluent Bit on the other hand is known for requiring minimal system resources for more lightweight method of forwarding your data.

For this configuration guide, we've covered using both Logstash & Fluent Bit together for forwarding your data for further 
log analysis and processing using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana).

The Logit.io platform is built to allow you to drive data-driven insights from your logs & brings together Fluent Bit & Logstash 
for full observability of your logs in a single centralised platform. Our platform offers a complete solution for centralising 
your log files from multiple applications and servers and provides a Fluent Bit log analyser as standard.
