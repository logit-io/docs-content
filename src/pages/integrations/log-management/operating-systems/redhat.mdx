Configure Filebeat to ship logs from Red Hat Systems to Logstash and Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat items={["RPM"]} />

  ### Enable The System Module

  There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the system module.

  Change directory to the location where filebeat was extracted and run the following commands:

  ```bash copy
  sudo filebeat modules list
  sudo filebeat modules enable system
  ```
  Navigate to the `modules.d` folder, copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the system.yml module file:

  ```yaml copy
  # Module: system
  # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12.2/filebeat-module-system.html

  - module: system
    # Syslog
    syslog:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:

  # Authorization logs
    auth:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:
  ```

  ### Update your configuration file

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of `filebeat.yml` 
  (this file can be found in the folder where you installed Filebeat in the first step).

  <Callout type="info">
    Filebeat modules offer the quickest way to begin working with standard log formats. 
    If you opt to configure Filebeat manually rather than utilizing modules, you'll do so by 
    listing inputs in the filebeat.inputs section of filebeat.yml. These inputs detail 
    how Filebeat discovers and handles input data. 
  </Callout>
    
  ```yml copy
  ###################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ==============================
  filebeat.inputs:
    - type: filestream
      enabled: true
      id: my_unique_id
      paths:
        # REQUIRED CHANGE TO YOUR LOGS PATH
        - /var/log/*.log
      fields:
        type: logfile
      
  # ============================== Filebeat modules ==============================
  filebeat.config.modules:
    path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml
    reload.enabled: false
    #reload.period: 10s

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  # ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
  output.logstash:
      hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
      loadbalance: true
      ssl.enabled: true

  # ================================= Processors =================================
  processors:
    - add_host_metadata:
        when.not.contains.tags: forwarded
    - add_cloud_metadata: ~
    - add_docker_metadata: ~
    - add_kubernetes_metadata: ~
  ```

  ### Validate Configuration
    
  ```ps1 copy
  sudo ./filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml --strict.perms=false
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    If the yml file is invalid, filebeat will print an `error loading config file` error message with details on how to correct the problem. 
    If you have issues starting filebeat see "How To Diagnose No Data In Stack" below to troubleshoot.
  </Callout>

  ### Start filebeat

  To start Filebeat, run:

  ```bash copy
  sudo chown root filebeat.yml 
  ```

  ```bash copy
  sudo chown root modules.d/system.yml
  sudo chown root module/system/syslog/manifest.yml
  sudo chown root module/system/auth/manifest.yml
  sudo ./filebeat -e
  ```

  You'll be running filebeat as root, so you need to __change ownership of the configuration file__ and any 
  configurations enabled in the modules.d directory, or run filebeat with __--strict.perms=false__ as shown above. 

  Read more about how to [change ownership](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/config-file-permissions.html).

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

### Red Hat Logging Overview

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is the most popular commercial Linux 
distribution used in public cloud environments. 

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is often compared to [CentOS](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/centos). 
The main difference between the two Linux distributions is that RHEL 
offers a much more comprehensive level of technical support to their users.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux generates a near overwhelming amount of log 
files under the `/var/log/` directory. Just under `/var/log/messages` 
alone there are mail, cron, daemon, kern & authentication logs. 

Below are some of the most notable log directories that you'll commonly encounter.

If you are using custom-built Kernels then you'll likely need to analyse the logs 
contained under /var/log/kern.log when it comes to troubleshooting your application.

The log messages found under /var/log/secure are relevant for monitoring the 
security of your Linux distribution as they contain authentication events, 
login attempts & authorisation log events.

You may also wish to consult  /var/log/setroubleshoot/ to discover issues related 
to the security context of logs files created under this directory.

With over 25 different log directories anyone would quickly find analysing their 
Red Hat system overwhelming without a log file analyser as part of a 
centralised [log management solution](https://logit.io/platform/logging/log-management/).

Our HA (highly available) Red Hat log file analyser can be used to completely 
centralise and manage your log file data across Red Hat & any additional applications, 
servers & programming languages for a single source of truth for monitoring across your organisation.

If you need any assistance with analysing your Red Hat logs we're here to help. 
Feel free to reach out by contacting the Logit.io support team 
via <IntercomButton text="live chat" /> & we'll be happy to help you start analysing your data.
