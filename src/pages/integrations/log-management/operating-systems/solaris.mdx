Configure syslog to ship logs from Solaris Systems to Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>  
  ### Download SSL Certificate

  Download root.logit.io.crt file and place in /etc/certs/syslog/keys/ca.d or another directory

  [https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt](https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt)

  ```bash copy
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/certs/syslog/keys/ca.d
  sudo curl -o /etc/certs/syslog/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt https://cdn.logit.io/root.logit.io.crt
  ```

  rsyslog trusts these root CA keys to validate the key presented by logit.io, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

  ### Locate rsyslog config

  `/etc/rsyslog.conf`

  <RsyslogConfig />

  Notes
    - If possible run the latest minor versions of rsyslog v7 or v8. There are many TLS bugs in past versions.
    - Ensure you have @@ not a single @ infront of the host. This is so TCP is used.

  ### Check which Solaris syslog is enabled

  Solaris has a system default syslog that we may need to disable. To check which system log is running use the below command.

  ```cmd copy
  svcs system-log
  STATE          STIME    FMRI
  disabled       11:16:28 svc:/system/system-log:rsyslog
  online         11:16:48 svc:/system/system-log:default
  ```

  Disable system-log:default

  ```cmd copy
  svcadm disable svc:/system/system-log:default
  ```
  Enable rsyslog

  ```cmd copy
  svcadm enable svc:/system/system-log:rsyslog
  ```
  The above commands can also be used to restart rsyslog if changes are made to the config file.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If you receive either of the following errors
          
  ```cmd copy
  could not load module '/usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so',
  rsyslog error -2078 [try http://www.rsyslog.com/e/2068 ]
  ```

  Or

  ```cmd copy
  could not load module '/usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so', 
  dlopen: /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [try http://www.rsyslog.com/e/2066 ]
  ```

  First, make sure that module actually exists by running ls against the path in the error, such as

  ```cmd copy
  ls -la /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so
  ```

  Ensure that the user which runs ```rsyslog``` has permissions to read logit.io's public key (in the instructions above, ```/etc/certs/syslog/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt```). 
  On many distributions, rsyslog starts as root and then drops to a user. In that case, run ```chmod 644 /etc/certs/syslog/keys/ca.d/root.logit.io.crt``` to let all users 
  read the key file.

  Finally, this may appear if you are using ```$ModLoad lmnsd_gtls``` to explicitly load the TLS module, and that configuration option occurs before the 
  ```$DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile``` has been defined. Explicitly loading the module is rarely required and the configuration above does not use it. 
  We recommend removing that ```$ModLoad lmnsd_gtls``` option and relying on autoloading. If your ```lmnsd_gtls``` needs to be explicitly loaded, like because it is in a 
  non-default location, move the ```$DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile``` config line above the ```$ModLoad``` line.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

### Solaris Logs Overview

Solaris is a Unix based OS. It is primarily used by Enterprise level businesses as it is highly 
[scalable](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-autoscaling) & supports the majority of commercially available commodity hardware 
(including HP & Dell).

Their Enterprise server extension includes support for clustering and is aimed towards observing business-critical environments. The OS is also 
known for its high system availability making it an ideal choice for businesses wishing to avoid outages and downtime.

Solaris logs hold a wealth of information on logon data (including failed attempts, FTP & Secure Shell activity data), user account changes, 
external device disk auditing & executions of Sudo commands. These can all be reported on once your data has been sent to Logstash, allowing 
your engineers visibility of critical threats to your operations.

Our Solaris log analysis platform can be used to review audit data in order to detect unauthorised activity & review patterns in access histories 
of users on your server. Our platform also allows you to set up [alerts](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-alerting) to gain 
real-time insights on system events affecting the security of your devices.
