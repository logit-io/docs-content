Send Serilog application logs to your Hosted ELK Logstash instance.

<Steps>
### Installing Serilog

You will need to add the `Serilog` and `Serilog.Sinks.Network` packages. 

```ps copy
Install-Package Serilog
Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Network
Install-Package Serilog.Settings.AppSettings
```

### Configuring Serilog

Add the following app settings to your `app.config` or `web.config`.

```xml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <!-- Level of logging -->
    <add key="serilog:minimum-level" value="Verbose" />
    <!-- Use the TCP Network sink -->
    <add key="serilog:using:TCPSink" value="Serilog.Sinks.Network" />
    <!-- Your logstash configuration -->
    <add key="serilog:write-to:TCPSink.uri" value="tls://@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort" />            
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

The `serilog:write-to:TCPSink.uri` value must be in the format "protocol://domain:port".

<Callout type="warning">
  If your Stack is missing a TCP-SSL input then you can send your logs using TCP or UDP instead, but this is not recommended.
  <IntercomButton text="Talk to support" /> if you need assistance adding a TCP-SSL input to your Stack.
</Callout>

### Using Serilog

Create a statically accessible Logger configured from AppSettings.
        
```c# copy showLineNumbers
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .ReadFrom.AppSettings()
  .CreateLogger();
```

You can now log from anywhere in your application.

```c# copy
Log.Information("The global logger has been configured");
```

Serilog is a fully featured logging framework and has many other capabilities that are not detailed here, 
please see the [Serilog Documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Getting-Started#setup) for more information.

### Check Logit.io for your logs

## Serilog Logging Overview

Serilog is a popular logging library for [.NET](/integrations/log-management/dotnet) and unlike many other logging libraries, 
it has been built with a focus on presenting log data in a structured & organised format. 
These [event log](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/event-log-analyser/) messages & log 
files are preserved in the [JSON](/integrations/log-management/json) format.

Without needing to alter your code, Serilog uses sinks to send logs in a text-based format to a 
centralised log management platform for further processing. If you can't or don't wish 
to use Serilog for structured logging, alternatively you can use 
either [NLog](/integrations/log-management/nlog) or [log4net](/integrations/log-management/log4net) for migrating your log data from .Net.

For alerting & monitoring, many Serilog users use an email sink for writing 
events to SMPT. This will quickly leave your inbox flooded when your application 
encounters an issue. A far less troublesome alternative to this can be to use an 
intuitive alerting and error monitoring platform that allows you to define alerts 
with a higher level of customisation & outputs to Slack, Asana, or WebHooks.

Logit.io provides alerting & monitoring as part of our platform that can be 
customised to output events to many popular third party tools. Our platform 
provides a completely managed Elastic Stack solution allowing you to get the 
best out of your .Net logs and provides a Serilog log analyser across all plans.
