import ConfigureSerilog from "@/components/integrations/partials/configure-serilog";

Use Serilog to easily send .NET Core logs to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Install

  You will need the main `Serilog.AspNetCore` package and `Serilog.Sinks.Network` to send logs using TCP/TLS or UDP.
  
  `Serilog.Settings.Configuration` is needed to setup Serilog using settings from appsettings.json (instead of hardcoded settings).
  
  ```ps copy 
  Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore
  Install-Package Serilog.Settings.Configuration
  Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Network
  ```

  ### Configuring Serilog
  <ConfigureSerilog />

  ### Using Serilog

  Inside `Program.cs`, add Serilog to the `WebHost` build process:
        
  ```csharp copy showLineNumbers
  public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
      WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
          .UseSerilog((ctx, config) => { config.ReadFrom.Configuration(ctx.Configuration); })
          .UseStartup<Startup>();
  ```
  
  You can now log from anywhere in your application.
  
  ```csharp copy
  Log.Information("The global logger has been configured");
  ```
  
  Serilog is a fully featured logging framework and has many other capabilities that are not detailed here.
  
  Please see the [Serilog.AspNetCore Documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore) for more information.

## .NET Core Logging Overview

.NET Core is an open-source platform created by Microsoft for development across Linux, 
macOS & Windows and makes [.NET](/integrations/logs/languages-and-libraries/dotnet) itself run as a cross-platform framework. 
It can be used to write APIs, and ASP.NET websites.
        
Tracing & tailing logs for .NET Core can often encounter difficulties when debugging over longer 
time periods. If these log messages are being recorded across distributed environments then it can 
make centralising your logs nearly impossible for logging analysis and management at scale.
        
The Logit.io platform offers [hosted Kibana](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-kibana) which 
makes visualising .NET Core log instances far more streamlined than comparable logging solutions. 
We believe that monitoring & analysis play a crucial role in maintaining the health of your applications across the cloud & on-premise.
