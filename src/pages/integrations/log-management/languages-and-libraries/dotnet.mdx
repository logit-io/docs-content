Use Serilog to send .NET logs to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Install

  If using Visual Studio, create a new application using the ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) template.

  If using a terminal application e.g. Powershell run the following command (where 'MyAspNetCoreApp' is the name of the application you want to create):

  ```ps copy
  dotnet new mvc -n MyAspNetCoreApp
  ```

  You will need to use NuGet or the command line to install three Serilog packages: `Serilog.AspNetCore` and `Serilog.Sinks.Network` to send logs using TCP/TLS or UDP.
  
  `Serilog.Settings.Configuration` is needed to setup Serilog using settings from appsettings.json (instead of hardcoded settings).
  
  In Powershell:
  ```ps copy 
  Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore
  Install-Package Serilog.Settings.Configuration
  Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Network
  ```

  If you are using Visual Studio, navigate to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet packages for solution, 
  browse for the 3 packages mentioned above and install them in your new application.

  ### Configuring Serilog
  <ConfigureSerilog />

  ### Using Serilog

  Inside `Program.cs`, add Serilog to the `WebApplication` build process:
        
  ```csharp copy showLineNumbers
  builder.Host.UseSerilog((hostContext, _, configuration) =>
  {
      configuration.ReadFrom.Configuration(hostContext.Configuration);
  });
  ```
  
  You can now log from anywhere in your application. For example, add the following line to the Index action in the HomeController file.
  
  ```csharp copy
  Log.Information("The global logger has been configured");
  ```
  
  Serilog is a fully featured logging framework and has many other capabilities that are not detailed here.
  
  Please see the [Serilog.AspNetCore Documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore) for more information.
