Use Serilog to easily send .NET logs to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Install

  You can ship logs from .NET and MONO applications using common logging frameworks. 
  We have documentation for:        
  
  - Serilog configuration
  - NLog configuration
  - log4net configuration
        
  <Callout type="info">
    I'm choosing a framework, which should I use? We recommend Serilog as it has structured logging support.
  </Callout>
      
  <Callout type="info">
    I can't use Serilog, NLog or Log4net! If you are not using a framework 
    listed above there are a number of options you can consider:

    - Log to file and use Filebeat to ship logs
    - Modify logging framework to output to HTTP
    - Modify logging framework to output to TCP
  </Callout>

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack source="dotnet" utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="dotnet" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

## .NET Logging Overview

.NET is a free development framework created by Microsoft that allows for easier application engineering. 
The framework provides an environment for programmers to use throughout the software development process. 

.NET is compatible with multiple libraries, editors and programming languages 
including F#, PowerShell, Visual Basic and IronPython.

By default .NET only works on [Windows](/integrations/logs/operating-systems/windows) devices, unless you use a tool like Mono to make .NET 
compatible with your Linux device. If cross operating system compatibility is a concern for your development 
process then you'll likely prefer using .NET Core as a framework of choice.

When .NET encounters an error these log files can be found by inspecting the 
[Windows event log](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/event-log-analyser/). 
.NET is associated with a number of log types including, security, application, OS, and 
[IIS](/integrations/logs/applications/iis) logs, as .NET applications typically run on IIS Servers.

Among these log types you'll also find statuses on the applications log events, 
in reverse severity these include Error, Warning & Information.

With all these logs being generated by a single development framework, it can be difficult to identify 
and visualise which of your .NET logs may be of highest importance when it comes to spotting errors and creating security reports.

Thanks to our [log viewer](https://logit.io/solutions/log-viewer/) and 
[ELK as a Service offering](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-as-a-service/), 
Logit.io makes parsing and managing your logs from .Net  effective. Our platform is able to centralise all 
of your log data across tools, platforms and services that you use on a daily basis.
