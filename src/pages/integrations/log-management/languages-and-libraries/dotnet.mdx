import ConfigureSerilog from "@/components/integrations/partials/configure-serilog";

Use Serilog to send .NET logs to your Logit.io Stack.

<Steps>
  ### Install

  If using Visual Studio, create a new application using the ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) template.

  If using a terminal application e.g. Powershell run the following command (where 'SerilogTestApp' is the name of the application you want to create):

  ```ps copy
  dotnet new mvc -n SerilogTestApp
  ```

  You will need to use NuGet or the command line to install three Serilog packages: `Serilog.AspNetCore` and `Serilog.Sinks.Network` to send logs using TCP/TLS or UDP.
  
  `Serilog.Settings.Configuration` is needed to setup Serilog using settings from appsettings.json (instead of hardcoded settings).
  
  In Powershell:
  ```ps copy 
  Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore
  Install-Package Serilog.Settings.Configuration
  Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Network
  ```

  If you are using Visual Studio, navigate to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet packages for solution, 
  browse for the 3 packages mentioned above and install them in your new application.

  ### Configuring Serilog
  <ConfigureSerilog />

  ### Using Serilog

  Inside `Program.cs`, add Serilog to the `WebApplication` build process. Below is the updated `Program.cs` code in full:
        
  ```csharp copy showLineNumbers
  using Serilog;

  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

  builder.Host.UseSerilog((hostContext, _, configuration) =>
  {
      configuration.ReadFrom.Configuration(hostContext.Configuration);
  });

  // Add services to the container.
  builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

  var app = builder.Build();

  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
  if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
  {
      app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
      // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
      app.UseHsts();
  }

  app.UseHttpsRedirection();
  app.UseStaticFiles();

  app.UseRouting();

  app.UseAuthorization();

  app.MapControllerRoute(
      name: "default",
      pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

  app.Run();
  ```
  
  You can now log from anywhere in your application. For example, the following code will send a warning log to your stack when the application 
  hits the Index action of the Home controller:
  
  ```csharp copy
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
  using SerilogTestApp.Models;
  using System.Diagnostics;

  namespace SerilogTestApp.Controllers
  {
      public class HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger) : Controller
      {
          public IActionResult Index()
          {
              logger.LogWarning("This is something you need to be warned about!");
              return View();
          }

          public IActionResult Privacy()
          {
              return View();
          }

          [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
          public IActionResult Error()
          {
              return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
          }
      }
  }
  ``` 

  ### Launch Logs to View Data

  Run the application and click on the button below to open the log management visualizer:

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />

  You should now see the above log stored in your stack.

Serilog is a fully featured logging framework and has many other capabilities that are not detailed here.
