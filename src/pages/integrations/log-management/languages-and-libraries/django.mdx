## Django Centralised Logging Overview

Django leverages Python's logging module, which is widely adopted across various 
third-party libraries, facilitating seamless integration of your application's 
logging with logs specific to your Django project.

The Python logging module categorizes logs into five standard levels: 
`CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`. 
Here's what each level signifies within a Django context:

- `CRITICAL` logs indicate severe problems that cause your Django application to terminate, necessitating a restart to recover.
- `ERROR` logs are for recording unexpected issues that can be resolved without restarting the application, such as HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) or 404 (Not Found) responses.
- `WARNING` logs might signal potential problems, like diminishing resources or the detection of suspicious HTTP requests, helping in safeguarding your application's security.
- `INFO` logs collect and convey data about your application's operational metrics, often sent to a log management solution like the ELK Stack for analysis.
- `DEBUG` logs provide detailed insights for debugging purposes, especially useful during development and troubleshooting stages.

When developing with Django, especially when transitioning to a production environment, 
the volume of logs can escalate rapidly, with each logging level adding to the complexity 
of managing and interpreting log data. This complexity underscores the importance of effective 
log management strategies to mitigate potential issues and facilitate smooth development workflows.

Logit.io offers a solution for centralizing and managing logs from Django applications, streamlining 
the processes of monitoring, troubleshooting, and debugging in the cloud. By aggregating all five types 
of logs, Logit.io enables efficient analysis through pre-configured Kibana dashboards. It also supports 
setting up alerts for critical issues and integrates with various notification services like Opsgenie, 
Slack, Webhooks, and PagerDuty to keep development teams informed.

For those looking to enhance their Django application logging with Logstash, Logit.io provides 
resources and support to simplify the migration process. Assistance is readily available through 
their Help Centre or live chat, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience to their logging platform.

Using Logit.io you can view all of the five log types for easy analysis with our out of the box
