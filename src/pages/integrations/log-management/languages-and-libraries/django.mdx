import ConfigurePythonLogstash from "@/components/integrations/partials/configure-python-logstash";

To send logs to Logit.io via Django you will need the python-logstash-async (version `2.5.0`) Python plugin.

<Steps>
  ### Installing the Python logging handler

  Execute the following command using `pip` (the official Python package installer) to install the logging handler. This sends Python logging 
  events to Logstash, which is part of your Logit.io log management stack:

  ```cmd copy
  pip install python-logstash-async
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    If you receive errors suggesting pip is an unknown command, 
    navigate to its installed location with your chosen terminal program and try again 
    (or add `pip` to your environmental variables if using Windows). 
  </Callout>

  ### Sending Logs
