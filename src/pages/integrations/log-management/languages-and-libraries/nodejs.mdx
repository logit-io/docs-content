Get started quickly with NodeJS logging using our configuration 
guide on how to easily ship NodeJS logs to your hosted Logstash and OpenSearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Introduction

  The example code used in this guide has been setup using Node.js v20.18.0 (64-bit). 
  Node Package Manager (npm) can be used to install the required `winston` (3.15.0) 
  and `winston-logstash` (1.2.1) packages.

  These will allow us to send log data from your Node.js application, to 
  your Logit.io stack. 
            
  For additional information, the official Winston documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).

  ### Installing

  First, ensure that you have downloaded and installed Node.js (32 or 64 bit). You can get 
  it from the official website, [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This includes various 
  options to install including using an installer file (for Windows or Mac).

  If you are just starting out with sending logs via Node.js there is a useful tutorial 
  for creating an 'express' application to help get you up-and-running 
  [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial#_an-express-application).

  Inside your project directory, open a terminal of your choice and type the following (this will install
  the latest version of Winston and winston-logstash):

  ```cmd copy
  npm install winston
  npm install winston-logstash
  ```

  ### Sending Logs

  To setup Winston, add the following code to your application before sending logs:
         
  ```javascript copy showLineNumbers /'@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes'/ /@logstash.host/
  const winston = require('winston');
  require('winston-logstash');

  const logger = winston.createLogger({
    transports: [
      new winston.transports.Logstash({
        port: '@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes',
        host: '@logstash.host',
        ssl_enable: true,
        max_connect_retries: -1,
      })
    ]
  });

  // Example usage
  logger.info('Hello, this is a log message!');
  ```
  
  You can then send logs using a Winston log method:
  
  ```javascript copy
  winston.error('This is a test error log message', { custom: 'my custom field', Environment: 'local' }); 
  ```
  
  The first parameter is the log `message` field. The second parameter allows you to specify additional fields, or modify default fields.
  
  You can send different levels of log records by using different winston log methods. This example uses the error method to send error log records. 
  Other log record levels and their corresponding winston methods include:
  
  ```javascript copy showLineNumbers
  winston.log("This is a standard log message");
  winston.info("This is an info log message");
  winston.warn("This is a warning log message");        
  ```

## Node.JS Logging Overview

Node.js is an open-source server-side platform built using JavaScript & was 
developed in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. As Node.js uses an event-driven, I/O model 
it is highly suited to powering real-time applications including live chat & 
chatbots, automatically refreshing feeds for social media, and additionally, 
it is increasingly used for sending web push notifications. It is most commonly 
run on Linux & Windows operating systems. 
        
Winston is the most popular logging library for Node.js as it makes logging 
more flexible & can be configured to multiple levels.  

Winston is well known for its robust feature set & easy installation which we 
have detailed in this configuration guide. Morgan is commonly used in association 
with Winston and operates as an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.

Parsing, transforming & analysing emergency, critical & error Node.js logs can 
be hard to perform at scale from the default logging format. Priority messages 
can easily get lost in the noise of other logging formats (such as Info & Notice) 
and are not alerted on to be resolved by your wider DevOps team. 

Logit.io provides a complete Node.js log analyser by default as part of our log 
management platform, this includes alerting, collection & visualisations enhancing 
your text logs to provide data-driven insights & real-time log tailing.
