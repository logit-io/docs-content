Get started quickly with Node.js logging using our configuration 
guide on how to easily ship Node.js logs to your hosted Logstash and OpenSearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Introduction

  The example code used in this guide has been setup using Node.js v20.18.0 (64-bit). 
  Node Package Manager (npm) can be used to install the required `winston` (3.15.0) 
  and `winston-logstash` (1.2.1) packages.

  These will allow you to send log data from your Node.js application, to 
  your Logit.io stack. 

  ### Installing

  First, ensure that you have downloaded and installed Node.js. You can get 
  it from the official website, [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This includes various 
  options to install including using an installer file (for Windows or Mac).

  If you are just starting out with sending logs via Node.js there is a useful tutorial 
  for creating an 'express' application to help get you up-and-running 
  [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial#_an-express-application).

  Inside your project directory, open a terminal of your choice and type the following (this will install
  the latest version of Winston and winston-logstash):

  ```cmd copy
  npm install winston
  npm install winston-logstash
  ```

  ### Sending Logs

  To setup Winston, add the following code to your application before sending logs:
         
  ```javascript copy showLineNumbers /'@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes'/ /@logstash.host/

  const winston = require('winston');
  const LogstashTransport = require("winston-logstash/lib/winston-logstash-latest");

  const logger = winston.createLogger({
    transports: [
      new LogstashTransport({
        port: '@logstash.sslPort:strip_quotes',
        host: '@logstash.host',
        ssl_enable: true,
        max_connect_retries: -1,
      })
    ]
  });
  ```
  
  You can then send logs using a Winston log method:
  
  ```javascript copy
  logger.info('Hello, this is a log message!');
  ```
    
  You can send different levels of log records by using different Winston log methods.
  Other log record levels and their corresponding winston methods include:
  
  ```javascript copy showLineNumbers
  winston.log("This is a standard log message");
  winston.error("This is an error log message");
  winston.warn("This is a warning log message");
  ```

  For additional information, the official Winston documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).
