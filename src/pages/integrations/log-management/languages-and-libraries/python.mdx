This guide has been setup and tested using Python `3.12` (64-bit) environments. 
Code samples included can be used inside a basic Python script, or web framework such as Django or Flask. 
To send logs to Logit.io in a Python script you will need the python-logstash-async (version `2.5.0`) Python plugin.

<Steps>
  ### Installing the Python logging handler

  Execute the following command using `pip` (the official Python package installer) to install the logging handler. This sends Python logging 
  events to Logstash, which is part of your Logit.io log management stack:
        
  ```cmd copy
  pip install python-logstash-async
  ```
    
  <Callout type="info">
    PIP is available by default on v3.4 or later of Python. If you are using an earlier version of Python consider updating to a more recent version. 
    Older versions are available [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/#history) but are no longer supported by the PIP development team.
