This guide has been setup and tested using Python `3.6-3.11` (64-bit) environments. 
Code samples included can be used inside a basic Python script, or web framework such as Django or Flask. 
To send logs to Logstash through Python you will need the python-logstash-async (version `2.5.0`) Python plugin.

<Steps>
  ### Installing the Python logging handler

  Execute the following command using `pip` (the official Python package installer) to install the logging handler. This sends Python logging 
  events to Logstash, which is part of your Logit.io log management stack:
        
  ```cmd copy
  pip install python-logstash-async
  ```
    
  <Callout type="info">
    PIP is available by default on v3.4 or later of Python. If you are using an earlier version of Python consider updating to a more recent version. 
    Older versions are available [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/#history) but are no longer supported by the PIP development team.

## Python Centralise Logging Overview

Python's logging module is used by most third-party libraries and allows you to integrate your log messages with application-specific logs.

The five standard levels of logs aggregated by the Python module include; `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`.

- Critical logs let you know that the application is shutting down and can't recover without a reboot.
- Error logs capture unexpected bugs that can be handled without a reboot, for example, a 503 or 404 error.
- Warnings can show that resources are running low or that suspicious web requests have been identified. 
  Warning logs can be monitored to protect the [security](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/security-monitoring/) of your applications.
- Info is log data that is sent to your ELK Stack that has captured information on your application's behaviour metrics.

The creation of a single Python script can produce thousands of logs which 
only increase once migrated to a production environment. Each logging level 
adds complexity to being able to efficiently report on the development process, 
as well as increasing the risk of breaking points across the module. 

Using the Logit.io platform allows you to centralise all five types of Python 
logs for the streamlining of monitoring, troubleshooting and debugging in the 
cloud. Our onboarding has your ELK Stacks ready for analysis of Python logging 
events in minutes by using our highly available hosted Logstash pipeline for 
collecting log files.

Using Logit.io you can view all of the five log types for easy analysis with 
our out of the box Kibana dashboards. Set alerts on errors, warnings and 
mission-critical Python issues from one centralised dashboard. Logit.io 
integrates with Opsgenie, Slack, Webhooks and PagerDuty to send 
notification messages to your Dev teams. 

If you need any further assistance with migrating your Python
