## Ruby Logging Overview

Ruby is an open sources object oriented programming language created in 
the mid 90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It is used by some of the web's most 
popular sites including Shopify, Twitch, Twitter, Airbnb and Github.

Ruby is well known for being easily comprehensible and has a syntax 
comparable to that of C and Java, it is also equally suited for frontend 
and backend development. Ruby also supports the majority of 
operating systems including Linux, Windows & Mac.

Ruby log events and errors can often be seen in two common locations, 
inline with the program's execution and in separate log files in an output such as /var/log/ruby.log

Ruby log levels include the following five statuses listed in 
decreasing priority order; `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`.

For live debugging, being able to see your errors in the program's 
execution is useful but for longer term log management an external 
solution is required for efficient processing, parsing and reporting.

Thanks to our [ELK as a Service platform](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-as-a-service), 
Logit.io makes parsing and managing your logs from Ruby easy and also 
provides actionable insights that can be used by your entire engineering 
and development team. Our platform is able to centralise all of your logs 
across numerous programming languages, tools, and cloud services that you use daily.
