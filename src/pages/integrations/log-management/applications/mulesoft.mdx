Use AnypointStudio and configure log4j using Socket Appender to ship Mule application logging entries to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
### Locate your log4j2.xml file

In Anypoint Studio you can configure your log4j2.xml file under the location src/main/resources.

### Configuring log4j2.xml

You will need to add the Socket appender to the log4j2.xml file. Under the RollingFile tag, inside the Appenders tag add the following snippet swapping the variables for the:
```cmd copy
<Socket name="socket" host="@logstash.host" port="@logstash.sslPort" protocol="ssl">
<PatternLayout pattern="{&quot;log_timestamp&quot;:&quot;%d&quot; ,&quot;log_thread&quot;:&quot;[%t]&quot; , &quot;log_level&quot;:&quot;%-5p&quot; , %m}%n" /> 
</Socket>
```

Then inside the tag `AsyncRoot level="Info"` you will need to add:
```cmd copy
<AppenderRef ref="socket" />
```

After adding these two snippets to your file your log4j2.xml file it should look like the example below:
```cmd copy
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
    <Appenders>
        <RollingFile name="file" fileName="${sys:mule.home}${sys:file.separator}logs${sys:file.separator}test.log" 
                filePattern="${sys:mule.home}${sys:file.separator}logs${sys:file.separator}test-%i.log">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n" />
            <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="10 MB" />
            <DefaultRolloverStrategy max="10"/>
        </RollingFile>
        
        <Socket name="socket" host="{{logstash.host}}" port="{{logstash.sslPort}}" protocol="ssl">
        <PatternLayout pattern="{&quot;log_timestamp&quot;:&quot;%d&quot; ,&quot;log_thread&quot;:&quot;[%t]&quot; , &quot;log_level&quot;:&quot;%-5p&quot; , %m}%n" /> 
        </Socket>
        
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <!-- CXF is used heavily by Mule for web services -->
        <AsyncLogger name="org.apache.cxf" level="WARN"/>
        
        <!-- Apache Commons tend to make a lot of noise which can clutter the log-->
        <AsyncLogger name="org.apache" level="WARN"/>
        
        <!-- Reduce startup noise -->
        <AsyncLogger name="org.springframework.beans.factory" level="WARN"/>
        
        <!-- Mule classes -->
        <AsyncLogger name="org.mule" level="INFO"/>
        <AsyncLogger name="com.mulesoft" level="INFO"/>
        
        <!-- Reduce DM verbosity -->
        <AsyncLogger name="org.jetel" level="WARN"/>
        <AsyncLogger name="Tracking" level="WARN"/>
        
        <AsyncRoot level="INFO">
            <AppenderRef ref="file" />
            <AppenderRef ref="socket" />
        </AsyncRoot>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

### Mulesoft Logging Overview

MuleSoft is the creator of a widely used IPaaS (integration-platform-as-a-service) that assists businesses with 
connecting data, devices and apps across [cloud](https://logit.io/solutions/monitoring/cloud-monitoring) platforms 
and on-premise services. This solution helps create a unified single-pane in the observability of key processes 
and applications across the enterprise.
                    
Mule's technology has allowed them to become a market leader among other integration tech suppliers in this space. 
Their popularity continues to grow among IT teams prioritising digital transformation & modernisation within their 
organisation.

Their AnyPoint Platform generates both runtime & [application logs](https://logit.io/platform/logging/logging-as-a-service/application-logging/) 
to help users troubleshoot activity from the MuleSoft server. These can be shipped to the Elastic Stack & visualised in Kibana 
to help administrators monitor errors, create dashboards & visualisations, as well as alert on irregularities in application 
activity.  

Log data generated from running Mule servers can be centralised and managed using Logit.io as both platforms are 
built to work hand in hand to help your business become scalable & ready for growth.
