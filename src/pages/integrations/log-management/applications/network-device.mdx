Send your network device logs to logit.io via logstash using the instructions below and begin searching your data.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Configure Your Device

  Configure your network device to send logs to TCP port 9000 of your Filebeat server. 

  You may need to consult your network device's documentation to do this.

  ### Configure Filebeat.yml

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.
          
  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

  ```yml copy
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
  filebeat.inputs:

    - type: tcp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:6515"
      enabled: true

      fields:
        type: networkdevice
        fields_under_root: true
        encoding: utf-8
        ignore_older: 12h

  # ================================== Outputs ===================================
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ["@logstash.host:@logstash.sslPort"]
    loadbalance: true
    ssl.enabled: true
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 7__, add this code block to the end. Otherwise, you can leave it out.

  ```yml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
  filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
  ```

  If you're running __Filebeat 6__, add this code block to the end.

  ```yml copy
  # ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
  registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
  ```
