<Steps>
  ### Install Integration

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Enable the NGINX module

      There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the nginx module:

      ```cmd copy
      .\filebeat.exe modules list
      .\filebeat.exe modules enable nginx
      ```

      In the module config under modules.d, change the module settings to match your environment. 
      You must enable at least one fileset in the module. 
      
      ___Filesets are disabled by default___.

      Copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the nginx.yml module file:

      ```yml copy
      # Module: nginx
      # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12/filebeat-module-nginx.html

      - module: nginx
        # Access logs
        access:
          enabled: true

          # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
          # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
          #var.paths:

        # Error logs
        error:
          enabled: true

          # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
          # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
          #var.paths:

## NGINX Logs Overview

NGINX is an open-source HTTP server and reverse proxy that was created by Igor Sysoev & released in 2004. 
It has gone on to power many of the web's highest traffic sites (including Netflix, Google & Wordpress) as 
it is a highly reliable server for enabling businesses to scale their operations.
          
Viewing NGINX log files can allow you to see spikes in 5XX/4XX status codes affecting the performance of 
your applications, and allow your Dev teams to drill down into the data to resolve errors. Analysing these 
at scale can rapidly drain your resources if your teams need to configure separate parsing, configuration, 
visualisation and reporting tools for a single large NGINX instance.


Many NGINX log analyzers can slow down the process of troubleshooting & increase time to resolution 
unnecessarily as they often struggle to process large amounts of log data. The Logit.io log management 
platform is built on ELK and can easily process large amounts of NGINX server data for root cause analysis. 


Our platform is built to scale with your infrastructure, once data is migrated to your ELK Stack you'll be 
able to benefit from automatic parsing with Logstash and visualise your NGINX metrics in Kibana. Alert on 
errors and notify your teams of spikes in real-time with our integrated alerting features that can send 
notifications to a variety of sources including Jira, Opsgenie, Slack, PagerDuty & Webhooks.

to help. Just get in touch with our support team via live chat & we'll be happy to assist.
