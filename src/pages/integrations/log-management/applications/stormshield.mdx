Ship your Stormshield logs to Logit.io via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
    ### Configure Stormshield to output to syslog

    Configure your Stormshield syslog server to output logs in legacy format over tcp port 6515.

    See [Stormshield Syslog Tab](https://documentation.stormshield.eu/SNS/v4/en/Content/User_Configuration_Manual_SNS_v4/Logs-syslog/Syslog_tab.htm) for more information on logging.

    ### Install Filebeat

    <InstallFilebeat />

    ### Configure Filebeat.yml

    The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack.
        
    Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of the Filebeat configuration file typically located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

    ```yml copy showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
    ####################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
    # ============================== Filebeat inputs ===============================
    filebeat.inputs:

    ### Storm Shield Logging Overview

    Stormshield is a network security company that provides a range of products and services to 
    protect networks from threats such as viruses, malware, and ransomware. Logging in Stormshield 
    refers to the process of collecting and analyzing log data generated by Stormshield devices to 
    monitor and troubleshoot network security issues.

    Stormshield devices generate various types of log data, including system logs, security logs, 
    and application logs. These logs contain information about events such as network traffic, 
    user activity, and security threats.

    Stormshield devices provide a range of logging options, including:

    _Syslog_: This is a standard protocol for forwarding log messages across IP networks. 
    Stormshield devices can be configured to send syslog messages to a syslog server, 
    which can be used to collect and analyze log data from multiple devices.

    _SNMP Traps_: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used to manage 
    and monitor network devices. Stormshield devices can be configured to send SNMP traps 
    to a central management system, which can be used to monitor the health and performance of the devices.

    _Real-time Monitoring_: Stormshield devices provide a real-time monitoring interface 
    that enables administrators to view log data in real-time. This can be useful for 
    quickly identifying and responding to security threats or network issues.

    _Analytics and Reporting_: Stormshield devices also provide analytics and reporting 
    capabilities, which enable administrators to analyze log data to identify trends 
    and patterns. This can be useful for identifying areas of the network that may be 
    vulnerable to security threats or for identifying potential performance issues.

    Overall, logging in Stormshield devices provides visibility into network activity 
    and security threats, which can help administrators monitor and troubleshoot network issues. 
    Stormshield devices provide a range of logging options, including real-time monitoring, 
    syslog, SNMP traps, and analytics and reporting, which enable administrators to collect 
    and analyze log data to identify and respond to security threats and network issues.
