Send your HashiCorp Vault logs to logit.io via logstash 
using the instructions below and begin searching your data.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat />

  ### Enable IIS module in Filebeat

  We need to enable the IIS module in Filebeat so that filebeat know to look for IIS logs.
  In Powershell run the following command:

  `.\Filebeat modules enable iis`

  Additional module configuration can be done using the per module config files located in the modules.d folder, 
  most commonly this would be to read logs from a non-default location
      
  __win__ `<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/`

  ```yml copy
  - module: iis
      # Access logs
      access:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      # var.paths: ["C:/inetpub/logs/LogFiles/*/*.log"]

      # Error logs
      error:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      # var.paths: ["C:/Windows/System32/LogFiles/HTTPERR/*.log"]
  ```

  ### Update Your Configuration File

  <UpdateFilebeatConfigFile />

  ### Validate configuration

  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" />

  ### Start filebeat
  
  <StartFilebeat />

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="iis" source="iis" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />
</Steps>

### IIS dashboard
The IIS module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### IIS Logging Overview

Applications developed for [.NET](/integrations/log-management/languages-and-libraries/dotnet) can 
be hosted on an IIS (Internet Information Services) web server which can only 
be used on the Windows operating system. IIS is commonly used to host web apps 
& static sites running on ASP.Net.
            
IIS is known for its high flexibility & rich features. The most recent version 
of IIS includes a number of out of the box security features including request 
filters, client certificate mapping & URL authorisation.

Modules for the latest version of IIS can be added as extensions to your 
configuration if required to process requests. These include modules for 
security, compression, content & caching which all hold a wealth of unique 
features essential to server administration teams.

Remote management is also included as part of the server's functionality 
making it an ideal choice for DevOps teams undertaking remote work.

All of this server activity generates a huge amount of log data for analysis. 
Our IIS log file analyser can be used to centralise your data & 
set up [alerts](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-alerting) to 
monitor your application security in real-time as well as deliver metrics 
for Kibana visualisations & reports easily.
