<Steps>
  ### Export Logs to Google Pub/Sub

  Ensure that you have Cloud Compute configured in [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs).

  Now we can filter the logs as needed, by clicking on the service name and choosing Show matching entries as shown below.

  ![Filter the logs that we want to export](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/filter_logs.png)

  <Callout type="info">
    Read more about how to configure and export logs using the [Google Operations Console](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2)
  </Callout>

  ### Create A Sink

  To export the logs choose Create sink as shown below.

  ![Select sink service](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss2.png)
  You will be then be prompted for:
  - Sink details (enter a name)
  - Sink destination (choose Cloud Pub/Sub topic creating a new topic if needed)
  - Choose logs to include in sink (this will have a filter applied already if you filtered the logs above)

  Choose Create sink to continue.

  ### Create Google Pub/Sub

  Locate your newly created [Pub/Sub topic](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/) and choose Create subscription.

  ![Find topic in Topics menu](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss5.png)
  
  Enter a suitable Subscription ID and leave the delivery type as pull.

  We don't need to change anything further at this stage, scroll to the bottom and choose CREATE to create the Subscription.

  ### Create Service Account

  Now in [service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), choose the project you're working with. 
      
  Then select CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT, this account will be used to retrieve logs from the Pub/Sub and send them to Logit.io.

  ![Service accounts screenshot](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss8.png)

  Name the service account and in step 2 add the role Pub/Sub Subscriber as shown below, then choose DONE.
  
  ![View new service account](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss11.png)

  Now choose Manage keys as shown below.

  ![Add key using dropdown](@/images/integrations/google-pubsub/gcp-ss12.png)

  Then choose ADD KEY > Create new key, choosing the recommended JSON format. This will download the JSON key to your machine ready to use in the next step.

  ### Configuring Logstash

  To start pulling logs and metrics from the Google Cloud Platform to your Stack you need to configure a Google Cloud Platform Input on your Logit.io Stack.

  <ConfigurePubSub type="" utmSource="pubsubbeat" utmMedium="google" utmCampaign="googlecloudcompute"/>

  <Callout type="info">
    Logit.io will verify your input before it is applied, we will contact you to confirm when this has been completed.
  </Callout>

  ### Launch Logit.io to view your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="google" utmCampaign="googlecloudcompute" source="pubsubbeat" />
</Steps>

## Cloud Compute Logging Overview

Cloud Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offering from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This IaaS platform enables 
users to launch virtual machines on demand through Google's data centers and extensive global network.

Cloud Compute is a comparable platform to [Microsoft Azure](/integrations/logs/azure/azure) & 
[Amazon EC2](/integrations/metrics/aws/ec2) and is often used as it is relatively inexpensive 
when compared to the two previously cited service providers. Some of the drawbacks of using 
GCP can include limited access to virtual machines based upon billing reliability of 
the organisation's account as if monthly spends are exceeded instances may be unavailable for use.

Compute Engine creates activity, usage, billing & audit logs that allow you track a variety of events affecting your deployment. 
For example; activity logs record the occurrence of API calls and system events as log messages. It is recommended that you 
prioritise activity logs over audit messages to follow through log analysis best practises.

With the amount of log messages and formats being generated by a single Infrastructure service it can be hard to know where 
to look first when it comes to debugging your applications and services running on virtual machines.

You can use Google Cloud Compute logs & metrics to visualise the performance of your services in 
[Hosted Kibana](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-kibana/) for intelligent reporting & by using our 
[log analysis platform](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/log-analysis) you can correlate the performance of your 
Compute Engines with the rest of your applications (even those based outside of Google services).

Our Cloud Compute log file analyser can be used to centralise your data, alert on preconfigured rules & monitor the health of all your virtual machine (VM) deployments.
