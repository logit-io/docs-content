<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor Azure Kubernetes 
  Service by collecting logs from the containers running on the host system. 
  Configure Filebeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and 
  ship Azure Kubernetes logs to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Download Filebeat Manifest File

  Download the filebeat kubernetes deployment manifest using the link below:

  [Click to download filebeat-kubernetes.yaml](https://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml)

  To do this on your Azure Cluster you can use the following command in the Azure Cloud Shell terminal. 

  ```cmd copy
  wget https://cdn.logit.io/filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ``` 

  ### Insert stack details

  Now you have the manifest you're going to want to add your Stack details. Open the file in a text editor.

  Locate the environment variables controlling the logging destination and enter your Stacks Logstash input information. 

  You need to change the environment variables around lines 54.

  ```yml copy
  env:
  - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
    value: "@logstash.host"
  - name: BEATS_PORT
    value: "@logstash.sslPort"
  ```

  ### Deploy Filebeat pod

  Now your Filebeat deployment manifest is updated with your Stack details, you can deploy it using the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:
          
  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f filebeat-kubernetes.yaml
  ```

  ### Confirm deployment succesful

  Confirm that your pod has successfully been deployed using one or all of the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell:

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl get po -A

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/filebeat

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
  ```

  You should see a pod for each Kubernetes node with a name similar to filebeat-abcde listed.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="azurekuberneteslogs" source="azure_kubernetes" />

  ## Metrics

  Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor Azure Kubernetes Service by 
  collecting metrics from the containers running on the host system. Configure Metricbeat 
  using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Azure Kubernetes service 
  metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Kube-State-Metrics

  You are going to need an instance of Kube State Metrics running in your cluster so that 
  we can access different metrics that aren't accessible using just Metricbeat. 
  Kube-state-metrics is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server 
  and generates metrics about the state of the objects.

  In the Azure cloud shell run the following command to download the kube-state-metrics.

  ```ps1 copy
  go get k8s.io/kube-state-metrics
  ```

  Now change into the newly downloaded directory:

  ```ps1 copy
  cd go/src/k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/
  ```

  Then to deploy this project to your cluster you simply run:

  ```ps1 copy
  kubectl apply -f examples/standard
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
      Read more about what configuration and options are available for [Kube State Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) 
      There are different settings and configurations you can use specifically for your cluster but for this example the default settings are being used.
  </Callout>

  ### Download Manifest File

  Download the metricbeat kubernetes deployment manifest using the link below:

  [Click to download metricbeatbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml](https://cdn.logit.io/metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml)

  ### Insert stack details

  Now you have the manifest you're going to want to add your Stack details. Open the file in a text editor.

  Locate the environment variables controlling the logging destination and enter your Stacks Logstash input information. 

  You need to change the environment variables around lines 54.

  ```yml copy
  env:
  - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
    value: "@logstash.host"
  - name: BEATS_PORT
    value: "@logstash.sslPort"
  ```

  This is because Kubernetes runs a Metricbeat instance on each node in the cluster and also an additional single instance of Metricbeat to retrieve metrics for the cluster itself.

  ### Deploy pod

  Now your Metricbeat deployment manifest is updated with your Stack details, you can deploy it using the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:

  ```ps1 copy
  kubectl apply -f metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml
  ```

  ### Confirm deployment succesful

  Confirm that your pod has successfully been deployed using one or all of the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell:
          
  ```ps1 copy
  kubectl get po -A

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get ds/metricbeat

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
  ```

  You should see a pod for each Kubernetes node with a name similar to metricbeat-abcde listed.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="azurekubernetes" source="azure_kubernetes" />

  ### Example Log

  You should now start to see logs arriving in Kibana from your Kubernetes cluster, similar to the example below.
