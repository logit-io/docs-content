Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your uWSGI 
servers by collecting metrics from the uWSGI server. Configure Metricbeat 
using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship uWSGI 
service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="uWSGI" />

  ### Configure Module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled/disabled. 
  Locate the configuration file for the uWSGI module.
        
  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```cmd copy
      /etc/metricbeat/modules.d/uwsgi.yml
      ```

    <Tab>
      ```cmd copy
      ~/<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/uwsgi.yml
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  By default the following metricsets are disabled. To enable or disable a 
  metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yml copy showLineNumbers
  - module: uwsgi
    # metricsets:
      # - status
    period: 10s
    hosts: ["tcp://127.0.0.1:9191"]
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="uwsgi_metricbeat" source="metrics_uwsgi" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The uWSGI metricsets were tested with uWSGI 2.0.15 and are expected to work with all version >= 1.4.9

  ### uWSGI Module Dashboard

  The uWSGI module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for 
  any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.
