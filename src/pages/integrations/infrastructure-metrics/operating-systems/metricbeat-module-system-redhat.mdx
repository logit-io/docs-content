Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers by 
collecting metrics from the operating system and from services running 
on the Redhat server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples 
below to collect and ship Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system, 
service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```bash copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can 
  be enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  `/etc/metricbeat/modules.d/system.yml`

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="redhat_metricbeat" source="metrics_system_redhat" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### System module dashboard

  The Metricbeat System module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your 
  dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### Redhat Overview

Metricbeat serves as a lightweight shipper, facilitating server monitoring through 
the accumulation of metrics from both the operating system and services active on 
the Redhat server. Utilize the provided predefined instructions to set up Metricbeat, 
enabling the compilation and forwarding of metrics and statisticsrelated to the Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system and its services to either Logstash or Elasticsearch.
