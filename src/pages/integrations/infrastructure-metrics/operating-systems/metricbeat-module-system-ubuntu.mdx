Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers by collecting 
metrics from the operating system and from services running on the Ubuntu server. 
Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Ubuntu 
operating system, service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```bash copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  `/etc/metricbeat/modules.d/system.yml`

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```
