Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers 
by collecting metrics from the operating system and from services running 
on the CentOS server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples 
below to collect and ship CentOS operating system, service metrics and 
statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```bash copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. 
  Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  `/etc/metricbeat/modules.d/system.yml`

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="centos_metricbeat" source="metrics_system_centos" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### System module dashboard

  The System module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### CentOS Overview

CentOS (short for Community Enterprise Operating System) is a popular and respected open-source Linux distribution known for its stability, reliability,
 and robust performance. 

It serves as a free and community-supported alternative to its commercial counterpart, [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/redhat). 
CentOS is widely utilized in enterprise environments, data centres, and web hosting services due to its strong focus on delivering 
a secure and consistent platform for various computing needs. 

One of CentOS's key strengths is its long-term support (LTS) approach, which ensures that security patches and updates are provided for an extended period. 
This stability makes it an ideal choice for mission-critical applications and server infrastructure. 

Additionally, CentOS benefits from a vast and active community of developers and users, which contributes to its continuous improvement and adaptability 
to evolving technologies. 

When it comes to collecting and shipping metrics from a CentOS-based environment, numerous tools and methodologies can be employed. This includes 
monitoring system performance, network activity, application behaviour, and more. 

By efficiently gathering and transmitting this data, organizations can gain valuable insights into the health and performance of their CentOS systems, 
enabling them to make informed decisions, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their infrastructure.
