Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers by 
collecting metrics from the operating system and from services running on 
the Windows server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples 
below to collect and ship Windows operating system, service metrics 
and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```ps1 copy
  PS > .\metricbeat.exe modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. 
  Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  ```txt copy
  <EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/system.yml
  ```

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric 
  simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="windows_system_metricbeat" source="metrics_system_windows" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### System module dashboard

  The Metricbeat System module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To 
  view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.
