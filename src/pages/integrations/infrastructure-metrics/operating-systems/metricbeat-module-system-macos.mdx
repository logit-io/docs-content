Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers by 
collecting metrics from the operating system and from services running on the 
macOS server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to 
collect and ship macOS operating system, service metrics and statistics 
to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```bash copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be 
  enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the system module. 

  `~/<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/system.yml`

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="macos_metricbeat" source="metrics_system_macos" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

### MacOS Overview

One of the key features of macOS is its user-friendly interface, which combines aesthetics with functionality. The Dock provides quick 
access to frequently used applications, while the Finder offers an intuitive file management system. 

MacOS also incorporates numerous built-in apps for productivity, creativity, and entertainment, such as Safari, Pages, Keynote, and 
iTunes. Under the hood, macOS boasts a Unix-based foundation, ensuring robust security and efficient multitasking. 

It includes advanced security features like Gatekeeper and FileVault to protect user data and privacy. In terms of performance, macOS 
benefits from Apple's hardware optimization, ensuring that Mac computers run smoothly and efficiently. 

It also supports virtualization, enabling users to run [Windows](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/windows) or Linux alongside macOS through tools 
like Boot Camp or virtual machines. For system administrators and service providers looking to collect and ship macOS operating 
system and service metrics, Logit.io serves as a complete solution for data centralisation and analysis.
