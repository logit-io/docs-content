Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics from the operating system and from services 
running on the Debian server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Debian operating system, 
service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the system module, run the following:

  ```bash copy
  metricbeat modules list
  metricbeat modules enable system
  ```

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  `/etc/metricbeat/modules.d/system.yml`

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: system
    period: 10s
    metricsets:
      - cpu
      - load
      - memory
      - network
      - process
      - process_summary
      - socket_summary
      #- core
      #- diskio
      #- socket
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="debian_metricbeat" source="metrics_system_debian" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### System module dashboard

  The System module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### CentOS Overview

Metricbeat, part of the Elastic Stack, is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to periodically collect metrics from 
the operating system and from services running on the server. It's designed to monitor and analyze system and service performance, sending 
the collected data to Elasticsearch for visualization with Kibana. One of the key modules in Metricbeat is the system module, which is 
particularly useful for monitoring the health and performance of servers running the Debian operating system, a popular choice for many 
servers due to its stability and security features.

The system module in [Metricbeat](/integrations/log-management/shippers/metricbeat) for [Debian](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/debian) 
servers collects a wide range of metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, file system disk space usage, network IO, and process metrics. 
These metrics are crucial for system administrators and DevOps teams to ensure that their Debian servers are running efficiently, identify 
potential bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues before they impact the performance of applications or services.

However, the volume and variety of metrics collected can be overwhelming, making it challenging to derive actionable insights without 
effective analysis and visualization tools. Logit.io offers a comprehensive solution to these challenges, providing an advanced analytics 
platform that enhances the capabilities of Metricbeat's system module on Debian servers. By integrating Metricbeat with Logit.io, users can 
leverage the power of the hosted ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to efficiently aggregate, analyze, and visualize their metrics.

With Logit.io, users can create customizable dashboards to monitor their Debian server performance in real-time, set up alerts based on 
specific thresholds or anomalies, and generate in-depth reports for historical analysis. This enables organizations to proactively manage 
their server health, optimize resource utilization, and ensure high availability and performance of their services.

 Our platform simplifies the management of system metrics, allowing you to gain deep insights into server performance and operational health. 
 Should you require assistance or wish to explore ways to improve your server monitoring and analytics strategy, Logit.io's support team is
