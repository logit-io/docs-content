Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your Windows server 
by collecting metrics from services and performance counters running on the 
Windows server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to 
collect and ship metrics about Windows services to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  There are several built in metricbeat modules you can use. To enable the uWSGI module, run the following:

  <Tabs items={["Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```cmd copy
      PS > .\metricbeat.exe modules enable uWSGI
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Configure module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the system module.

  <Tabs items={["Windows"]}>

    <Tab>
      `<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/system.yml`
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  By default the following metrics are enabled. To enable or disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yaml copy
  - module: windows
    #metricsets:
    #  - service
    period: 1m

  #- module: windows
  #  metricsets:
  #    - perfmon
  ```

  The perfmon metricset of the Windows module reads Windows performance counters.
  The service metricset of the Windows module reads the status of Windows services.

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="windows_metricbeat" source="metrics_windows" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### System module dashboard

  The Windows module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### uWSGI Metricbeat Module Overview

Windows operating systems, being among the most widely used platforms in both enterprise and personal computing environments, offer a rich set of metrics crucial 
for system health and performance monitoring. The Metricbeat Module for Windows Systems taps into these metrics, covering aspects such as CPU usage, memory consumption, 
disk I/O, network statistics, and more, providing a holistic view of the system's status.

This module stands out for system administrators and IT professionals managing Windows environments for its ease of configuration and its seamless integration with the 
[ELK Stack](https://logit.io/blog/post/elk-stack-guide/). This powerful combination enables real-time visibility into Windows metrics, facilitating 
advanced analysis, visualization, and alerting capabilities that go beyond the scope of traditional monitoring tools.

In comparison to other monitoring solutions that may utilize proprietary formats or offer limited flexibility, the Metricbeat Module for System Windows is specifically 
designed to simplify analysis, troubleshooting, and operational oversight within Windows environments.

Our platform extends support for the Metricbeat Module for Windows Systems, offering centralized metrics management tailored for effortless analysis and proactive system 
monitoring. This eliminates the challenges associated with manually aggregating and interpreting metrics across distributed Windows systems.
