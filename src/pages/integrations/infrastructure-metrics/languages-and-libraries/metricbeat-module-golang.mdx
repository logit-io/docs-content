Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your Golang servers by collecting 
metrics running on the Golang server. Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples 
below to collect and ship Go programming language service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="golang" />

  The golang module collects metrics by submitting HTTP GET requests to golang-expvar-api.

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="golang">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: golang
      #metricsets:
        # - expvar
        # - heap
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["localhost:6060"]
      heap.path: "/debug/vars"
      expvar:
        namespace: "example"
        path: "/debug/vars"
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="golang_metricbeat" source="metrics_golang" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Golang Module Dashboard

  The Golang module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards 
  for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

## Golang Metricbeat Module Overview

The Metricbeat Module for Golang is a targeted tool designed for the comprehensive 
monitoring of Golang applications by capturing essential metrics. Those who have 
previously engaged with Metricbeat's data collection capabilities across different 
services will find its adaptation to Golang both intuitive and highly effective.

Golang, or Go, is celebrated for its efficiency, concurrency support, and 
ease of use in developing scalable and high-performance applications. The 
Metricbeat Module for Golang connects to the Go runtime to extract valuable 
metrics such as garbage collection statistics, memory allocation, and 
goroutine counts, offering deep insights into application performance and health.

This module has quickly become indispensable for developers, DevOps engineers, 
and system administrators who manage Golang applications, thanks to its easy 
configuration and the seamless integration with the [ELK Stack](https://logit.io/blog/post/elk-stack-guide/). 
This combination unlocks real-time monitoring and analytical capabilities, providing a level of insight 
and operational visibility that greatly exceeds that of conventional monitoring tools.

Unlike other monitoring solutions that may rely on custom or rigid data formats, 
the Metricbeat Module for Golang is crafted to simplify the analysis, troubleshooting, 
and monitoring of Golang applications, ensuring ease of use and comprehensive coverage.

Our platform supports the Metricbeat Module for Golang, providing centralized 
[metrics management](https://logit.io/platform/metrics/metrics-management/) designed for 
effortless analysis and proactive monitoring. This eliminates the challenges associated 
with manually aggregating and interpreting metrics across distributed Golang applications.

If you require assistance with configuring the Metricbeat Module for Golang or have 
questions about monitoring your Golang applications, the Logit.io team is prepared 
to assist. We invite you to visit our Help Centre or reach out to our support team
