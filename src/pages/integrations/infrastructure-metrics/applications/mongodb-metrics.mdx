Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your MongoDB servers by collecting metrics running on the MongoDB server. 
Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship MongoDB service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="mongodb" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="mongodb">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: mongodb
      #metricsets:
      #  - dbstats
      #  - status
      #  - collstats
      #  - metrics
      #  - replstatus
      period: 10s
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="mongodb_metricbeat" source="metrics_mongodb" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The MongoDB metricsets were tested with MongoDB 3.4 and 3.0 and are expected to work with all versions >= 2.8.
</Steps>

### MongoDB Module Dashboard

The MongoDB module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards 
for any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

### MongoDB Overview

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system renowned for its flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in managing 
and storing vast volumes of data, making it a prime choice for handling shipping logs effectively. 
This overview provides a concise understanding of MongoDB's relevance in the context of shipping [log management](/platform/logging/log-management/). 
      
MongoDB is a document-oriented database that organizes data into JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents, 
allowing for easy storage and retrieval of unstructured or semi-structured data, a common format for shipping logs. 

Its dynamic schema design accommodates changes in data structure without necessitating a predefined schema, 
enabling smooth adaptation to evolving shipping log requirements. 

MongoDB's horizontal scalability, achieved through sharding, makes it well-suited for handling high-volume 
shipping logs, distributing data across multiple servers for improved performance and fault tolerance. 
This ensures that as your shipping log data grows, MongoDB can seamlessly accommodate the increasing workload. 

Additionally, MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities and indexing support allow for efficient retrieval 
and analysis of shipping log data to an external service such as Logit.io, facilitating real-time monitoring, trend analysis, and reporting. 
Its robust security features and access controls ensure that sensitive shipping information remains protected.
