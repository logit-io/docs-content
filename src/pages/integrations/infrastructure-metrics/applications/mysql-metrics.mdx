Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your MySql database servers by collecting metrics running on the MySql server. 
Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship MySql database server metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="mysql" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="mysql">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: mysql
      metricsets:
        - status
        - galera_status
      period: 10s
    ```

    You will also need to enter the host location of the database and the username and password to access it.

    ```cmd copy
    # Host DSN should be defined as "user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"
    # The username and password can either be set in the DSN or using the username
    # and password config options. Those specified in the DSN take precedence.
    hosts: ["(127.0.0.1:3306)/"]

    # Username of hosts. Empty by default.
    username: root

    # Password of hosts. Empty by default.
    password: secret
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="mysql_metricbeat" source="metrics_mysql" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The mysql MetricSets were tested with MySQL and Percona 5.7 and 8.0 and are expected to work with all versions >= 5.7.0. 
  It is also tested with MariaDB 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.

### MySQL Overview

MySQL is an [open-source](/blog/post/open-source-dashboard/) relational database management system (RDBMS) 
that has gained widespread popularity for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. 
      
It serves as a critical component for storing and managing data in various applications, including 
web services, content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and more. 

MySQL metrics can encompass various aspects, such as query execution times, server resource utilization, throughput, and error rates. 

Collecting these metrics involves the use of monitoring tools and software, which periodically 
gather data from MySQL servers and then ship it to a centralized location or analytics platform for analysis and visualization. 

By implementing robust monitoring and metric collection processes by using a platform like Logit.io, 
organizations can proactively manage and optimize their MySQL databases, ensuring efficient performance, 
high availability, and the ability to scale as their data needs grow.
