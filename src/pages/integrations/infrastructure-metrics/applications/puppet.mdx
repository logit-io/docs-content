Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor Puppet 
performance metrics by collecting metrics running on the Puppet Agents. 
Configure Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect 
and ship Puppet metrics to Logstash or Elasticsearch. 

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Requirements

  In order for puppet metrics to be shipped correctly you have to have the following server pre-requisites.

  - Puppet Server 5.0 or above, tested on version 6
  - Jolokia agent installed
  - Tested on Ubuntu server

  ### Install Jolokia Agent

  Download [Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi) and then extract it.

  ```cmd copy
  tar zxvf apache-tomcat-7.*.tar.gz 
  cd apache-tomcat-7.*
  TC=`pwd`
  ```

  Download the Jolokia WAR-agent and copy it into Tomcat's webapp directory.
  
  ```cmd copy
  cd $TC/webapps
  wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jolokia/jolokia-war/1.2.3/jolokia-war-1.2.3.war
  mv jolokia-war-1.2.3.war jolokia.war
  ```

  ### Verify Jolokia Installation

  Now the container can be started with.

  ```cmd
  $TC/bin/catalina.sh start
  ```

  In order to verify the installation was successful, point your browser to:

  [http://localhost:8080/jolokia/version](http://localhost:8080/jolokia/version)

  Your response should have status 200 in the json data.

  ### Configure Jolokia

  To change the security access policy for Jolokia.

  Create the `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/jolokia-access.xml` file with contents below 
  that follow the Jolokia access policy. 

  ```xml showLineNumbers copy filename="/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/jolokia-access.xml"
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <restrict>
    <remote>
      <host>${PUPPET-HOST-SERVER}</host>
    </remote>
    <http>
      <method>post</method>
    </http>
    <commands>
      <command>read</command>
      <command>list</command>
    </commands>
    <allow>
      <mbean>
        <name>java.lang:type=Memory</name>
        <operation>gc</operation>
      </mbean>
    </allow>
    <deny>
      <mbean>
        <name>com.mchange.v2.c3p0:type=PooledDataSource,*</name>
        <attribute>properties</attribute>
      </mbean>
    </deny>
  </restrict>
  ```

  Uncomment the `metrics.metrics-webservice.jolokia.servlet-init-params.policyLocation` 
  parameter and then restart the puppet server.

  ### Install Metricbeat

  <Tabs items={["deb (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)", "rpm (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)"]} unlink>
    <Tab>
    ```cmd copy
    curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-oss-7.6.2-amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i metricbeat-oss-7.6.2-amd64.deb
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>        
    ```cmd copy
    curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-oss-7.6.2-x86_64.rpm
    sudo rpm -vi metricbeat-oss-7.6.2-x86_64.rpm
    ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>    

  ### Locate Configuration File

  `/etc/metricbeat/metricbeat.yml` 

  ### Configure Output

  We'll be shipping to your hosted Logstash so that we have the option to apply filters 
  before the data is indexed into Elasticsearch. 
  
  Comment out the elasticsearch output block:

  ```yml copy
  ## Comment out elasticsearch output
  #output.elasticsearch:
  #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  ```

  <ConfigureOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="jolokia" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="jolokia">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: jolokia
      metricsets: ["jmx"]
      enabled: true
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["localhost:8080"]
      namespace: "jolokia_metrics"
      path: "/jolokia"
      http_method: 'GET'
      jmx.mappings:
        - mbean: 'java.lang:type=Memory'
          attributes:
          - attr: HeapMemoryUsage
            field: memory.heap_usage
          - attr: NonHeapMemoryUsage
            field: memory.non_heap_usage
        - mbean: 'Catalina:name=*,type=ThreadPool'
          attributes:
          - attr: port
            field: catalina.port
          - attr: maxConnections
            field: catalina.maxConnections
        - mbean: 'java.lang:type=Runtime'
          attributes:
          - attr: Uptime
            field: uptime
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

## Puppet Overview

Puppet is a leading configuration management (CM) system that makes the process of 
automating common tasks for DevOps & Sysadmins manageable. The platform can also be 
used to eliminate the need for manual configuration in order to deploy servers automatically. 

This IT automation software can manage many of the common operations for maintaining 
system infrastructure including patching, provisioning, and management of operating 
systems & servers across on-premise and cloud environments.

Puppet are technology partners with many of the biggest leaders in the cloud computing 
space, including [Microsoft Azure](/integrations/log-management/azure) & Amazon Web Services. 
They work with over 30,000 companies globally helping them to secure their infrastructure, 
including [Red Hat](/integrations/log-management/operating-systems/redhat), Cisco, & Salesforce. 

Puppet has been deployed across especially large infrastructures managing in excess of 5000+ machines. 
As Puppet is built for dynamically scaling and centralising machine activity, their platform 
works hand in hand with Logit.io to scale your infrastructure and centralise your data. Logit.io 
provides you with a scalable alternative for inspecting Puppet metrics data fast. Logit.io also 
enables you to visualise key performance metrics for Puppet using 
our [Hosted Kibana](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-kibana) integration.

Puppet metrics include key insights on the number of changes the application has made, resources 
managed, and the type of events that have occurred. Each of the metricâ€™s log messages has a name, 
label, and values that make it easy to parse when using Logstash to transform your files.

If you need any further assistance with migrating your Puppet metric logs to Logit.io we're here 
to help you get started. Feel free to get in contact with our support team by 
sending us a message <IntercomButton text="via live chat" /> and we'll be happy to assist.
