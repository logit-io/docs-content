Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor 
your PostgreSQL database servers by collecting metrics running 
on the PostgreSQL server. Configure Metricbeat using the 
pre-defined examples below to collect and ship PostgreSQL database 
server metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="PostgreSQL" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="PostgreSQL">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: postgresql
      metricsets:
        - database
        - bgwriter
        - activity
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["postgres://localhost:5432"]
      username:
      password:
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="postgresql_metricbeat" source="metrics_postgresql" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The PostgreSQL module was tested with PostgreSQL 9.5.3 and is expected to work with all versions >= 9.

## PostgreSQL Overview

PostgreSQL, often referred to as Postgres, is a powerful open-source relational database management 
system (RDBMS) renowned for its robustness, flexibility, and extensibility. It was initially 
developed at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1980s and has since evolved into one 
of the most popular and trusted database solutions worldwide. 
      
PostgreSQL excels in handling complex data structures, supporting various data types, 
including [JSON](/integrations/log-management/data-types/json), XML, and geospatial data, 
making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, 
Isolation, Durability) compliance ensures data integrity and reliability. 
      
When it comes to collecting and shipping PostgreSQL metrics, administrators 
and developers can tap into a plethora of built-in monitoring tools and 
extensions. PostgreSQL provides a comprehensive set of metrics, ranging from 
query performance and resource utilization to transaction statistics and replication status. 
      
Administrators can access these metrics via system views and functions or employ 
third-party tools and extensions for more advanced monitoring. To effectively 
collect and ship PostgreSQL metrics, various solutions and integrations are available, 
including monitoring agents, log analyzers (such as the one provided by Logit.io), 
and cloud-based services. 
      
These tools enable organizations to gain insights into their PostgreSQL database's 
performance, identify bottlenecks, and proactively address issues to ensure optimal database operation.
