Metricbeat is an open source shipping agent that lets you ship AWS Elastic 
Kubernetes Service (EKS) Metrics to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Prerequisites

  Firstly Make sure you have the aws cli, eksctl & kubectl installed on local machine 
  using the [following guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).

  Also make sure you have setup aws configure with your AWS credentials. 

  To do this run run the following command in your aws terminal.

  ```cmd copy
  aws configure
  ```

  When you type this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: access key, secret access key, AWS Region, and output format. 
  This information is stored in a profile named default. This profile is used when you run commands, unless you specify another one.

  ### Connecting to the cluster 

  Update your config by running the following command. Replace `<enter_region>` and `<enter_name>` with your AWS cluster region and name.
  
  ```cmd copy
  aws eks --region <enter_region> update-kubeconfig --name <enter_name>
  ```

  Check you can connect to your cluster by running the following command:

  ```
  kubectl get svc
  ```

  ### kube-state-metrics

  You will need an instance of kube-state-metrics running on your cluster before you install metricbeat.

  Cloning the kube-state-metrics repository locally and applying the example is the easiest way to generate some metrics. 
  You can tailor these to your needs at a later stage.

  ```cmd copy
  git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics.git
  ```

  Change into the newly downloaded directory:

  ```cmd copy
  cd go/src/k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/
  ```

  Then to deploy this project, you can simply run:

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f examples/standard
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    Metricbeat requires kube-state-metrics to be deployed and running to gather the cluster metrics. 
    You can read more about kube state metrics on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics).
  </Callout>

  ### Deploy Metricbeat

  You're going to need the metricbeat deployment manifest.

  ```cmd copy
  curl -L -O cdn.logit.io/metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml
  ```

  Now you have the manifest we need to add your Stack Logstash endpoint details. 
  Open the file in the terminal editor using the vim or nano command. 
  Alternatively you can choose Open Editor from the console toolbar to make your changes.

  ```cmd copy
  vi metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml
  ```
  
  or

  ```cmd copy
  nano metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml
  ```

  Update the following lines in the yaml with your Stack Logstash endpoint and Beats-SSL port.
  
  <Callout type="info">
    The code snippet occurs two times in the yaml file and needs updating in both.
  </Callout>

  ```yml copy
  env:
  - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
    value: "guid-ls.logit.io"
  - name: BEATS_PORT
    value: "00000"
  ```

  After updating the code should look as below.

  ```yml copy
  env:
  - name: LOGSTASH_HOST
    value: ["@logstash.host"]
  - name: BEATS_PORT
    value: ["@logstash.sslPort"]
  ```

  Exit and save the file.

  ### Apply your updates

  Now we're going to apply the file to the cluster.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl apply -f metricbeat-kubernetes-7.10.0.yaml
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    If you need to apply further updates after running the apply command 
    you may need to remove the yaml file, make your changes and then apply again.
  </Callout>

  ### Confirm Deployment

  Confirm your pod has deployed, you should see output similar to that below.

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl get po -A
  ```

  or

  ```cmd copy
  kubectl logs ["podname"] --namespace=kube-system
  ```

  Browse to Kibana and you should see Metrics arriving in your Stack.

  ### Check Logit.io for your metrics

## AWS EKS Overview

To efficiently collect and analyze AWS EKS metrics, an effective solution is to integrate with Logit.io, a 
leading cloud-native observability platform. By sending your AWS EKS metrics to Logit.io, you can access 
advanced analytics and visualization tools to make informed decisions about your Kubernetes workloads. 
This includes setting up real-time dashboards, alerts, and anomaly detection to proactively identify and 
address any issues or performance bottlenecks, ensuring optimal resource utilization and a reliable user experience. 

While monitoring metrics is essential, for a holistic approach to AWS EKS observability, it's equally crucial to explore AWS EKS Logs. 
These logs provide invaluable insights into your applications and infrastructure behaviour. To delve deeper into harnessing the 
full potential of AWS EKS Logs, explore our dedicated integration. By combining AWS EKS Metrics and Logs within the Logit.io 
ecosystem, you gain a comprehensive and reliable monitoring strategy to manage your Kubernetes workloads with precision and confidence.

Logit.io's [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/) excels in providing fully scalable integrations for these components.
