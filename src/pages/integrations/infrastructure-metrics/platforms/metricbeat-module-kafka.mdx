Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your Kafka servers 
by collecting metrics running on the Kafka server. Configure Metricbeat using 
the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Apache Kafka service 
metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="kafka" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="kafka">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: kafka
      # metricsets:
        # - partition
        # - consumergroup
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["localhost:9092"]
      
      #client_id: metricbeat
      #retries: 3
      #backoff: 250ms
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>
  
  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="kafka_metricbeat" source="metrics_kafka" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The Kafka modules are tested with Kafka `0.10.2.1`, `1.1.0` and `2.1.1`.

  ### Kafka Module Dashboard
  
  The Kafka module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for 
  any of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

## Kafka Metricbeat Module Overview

The Metricbeat Module for [Kafka](/integrations/log-management/applications/kafka) is a specialized tool designed 
for the efficient monitoring of Kafka clusters by capturing a wide array of performance metrics. 
For those already familiar with [Metricbeat's](/integrations/log-management/shippers/metricbeat) capabilities in 
aggregating data from different services, its extension to Kafka brings a 
familiar yet powerful monitoring solution to the table.

Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, plays a crucial role in data processing 
and real-time streaming analytics. The Metricbeat Module for Kafka leverages 
Kafka's JMX metrics to gather data on topics, partitions, brokers, and more, 
offering deep insights into throughput, latency, and system health.

This module is particularly valued by DevOps, data engineers, and system administrators 
tasked with overseeing Kafka clusters. Its straightforward setup and integration 
with the [ELK Stack](https://logit.io/blog/post/elk-stack-guide/) enable real-time 
monitoring and analysis, significantly enhancing operational visibility and the 
ability to react swiftly to changes in system performance.

Compared to other monitoring methods that may rely on bespoke or rigid formats, 
the Metricbeat Module for Kafka is crafted to offer ease of analysis, streamlined 
troubleshooting, and comprehensive operational oversight for Kafka environments.

Our platform supports the Metricbeat Module for Kafka, offering centralized management 
of metrics that facilitates straightforward analysis and proactive monitoring. 
This support removes the complexity of manually tracking and 
interpreting metrics across distributed Kafka clusters.

Should you need help with configuring the Metricbeat Module for Kafka or have 
questions about monitoring your Kafka clusters effectively, the Logit.io team 
is ready to assist. We encourage you to visit our Help Centre or reach out to our 
support team <IntercomButton text="via live chat" /> and we'll be happy to assist.
