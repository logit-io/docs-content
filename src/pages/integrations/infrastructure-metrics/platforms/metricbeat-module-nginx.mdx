Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your NGINX web 
servers by collecting metrics running on the NGINX server. Configure 
Metricbeat using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship NGINX 
web service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="nginx" />

  ### Configure Module

  <ConfigureMetricbeatModule module="nginx">
    ```yml copy showLineNumbers
    - module: nginx
      metricsets:
        - stubstatus
      period: 10s
    
      # NGINX hosts
      hosts: ["http://127.0.0.1"]
    
      # Path to server status. Default server-status
      server_status_path: "nginx_status"
    
      #username: "user"
      #password: "secret"
    ```
  </ConfigureMetricbeatModule>

  In order for the status metricset to work and correctly display the 
  dashboard on Kibana, you will need to enable ngx_http_stub_status on your NGINX web server.

  ### Start Metricbeat

  Start or restart [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="nginx_metricbeat" source="metrics_nginx" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />
  
  ### Compatibility

  The NGINX metricsets were tested with NGINX `1.9` and are expected to work with all versions >= `1.9`.

  ### NGINX Module Dashboard

  The NGINX module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards. To view your dashboards for any 
  of your Logit.io stacks, launch Logs and choose Dashboards.

## NGINX Metricbeat Module Overview

The Metricbeat Module for NGINX is an expertly crafted tool designed to 
enhance the monitoring of NGINX servers by gathering crucial metrics. 
For those who have previously utilized Metricbeat for data collection 
across various platforms, its application to NGINX will be both 
familiar and remarkably efficient.

NGINX, known for its high performance, scalability, and ability to 
handle large volumes of concurrent connections, is a cornerstone in modern 
web architectures. The Metricbeat Module for NGINX taps into NGINX's status 
module to collect important metrics such as active connections, request 
rates, and error logs. This module thus provides vital insights into 
server performance, enabling proactive management and optimization.

This module is a favored choice among system administrators 
and [DevOps](https://logit.io/blog/post/what-is-devops/) professionals 
responsible for maintaining NGINX servers, thanks to its straightforward 
configuration and its seamless integration with the Elastic Stack. This 
powerful synergy offers an advanced platform for monitoring, visualizing, 
and analyzing NGINX metrics in real time, far surpassing the 
capabilities of traditional monitoring tools.

In contrast to other monitoring solutions that might use proprietary or 
inflexible formats, the Metricbeat Module for NGINX is designed for 
simplicity, thorough analysis, and ease of troubleshooting within NGINX environments.

Our platform extends robust support for the Metricbeat Module for NGINX, 
providing centralized metrics management designed for effortless analysis 
and active monitoring of your NGINX servers. This eliminates the need 
for manual metric collection and analysis across distributed server environments.

If you're seeking assistance with setting up the Metricbeat Module for 
NGINX or have any questions about how to best monitor your NGINX servers, 
the Logit.io team is here to help. Feel free to visit our Help Centre or
