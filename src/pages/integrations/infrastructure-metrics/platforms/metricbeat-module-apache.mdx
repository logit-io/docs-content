Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor your Apache HTTPD 
servers by collecting metrics running on the Apache server. Configure Metricbeat 
using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Apache web service 
metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable Module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="apache" />

  ### Configure Module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets 
  can be enabled / disabled. Locate the configuration file for the Apache module.
        
  <Tabs items={["DEB/RPM", "macOS/Windows"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```txt copy
      /etc/metricbeat/modules.d/apache.yml
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```txt copy
      ~/<EXTRACTED_ARCHIVE>/modules.d/apache.yml
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  By default the status metricset is disabled. To enable or 
  disable a metric simply comment or uncomment the line out.

  ```yml copy
  - module: apache
  metricsets:
    #- status
  period: 10s
  hosts: ["localhost:8080"]
  ```

  In order for the status metricset to work & correctly display the dashboard 
  on Kibana, you will need to enable `mod_status` on your Apache server.

  ### Start Metricbeat

  [Start or restart Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-starting.html) 
  to apply the configuration changes.

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="apache_metricbeat" source="metrics_apache" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility

  The Apache metricsets were tested with Apache `2.4.12` and `2.4.20` 
  and are expected to work with all versions >= `2.2.31` and >= `2.4.16`.

  ### Apache Module Dashboard

  The Apache module comes with predefined Kibana dashboards.

## Apache MetricBeat Module Overview

The Metricbeat Module for [Apache](/integrations/log-management/applications/apache) is a specialized tool crafted 
to enhance the monitoring of Apache servers by collecting critical metrics. 
For users already familiar with Metricbeat's capabilities in aggregating data 
from various sources, its application to Apache serves as a seamless extension, 
offering a robust solution for Apache monitoring.

Apache HTTP Server, being one of the most widely used web servers in the world, 
provides a rich set of features and metrics crucial for understanding server 
performance, including request handling efficiency, worker status, and load 
distribution. The Metricbeat Module for Apache leverages Apache's mod_status 
to fetch these metrics, enabling detailed insights into server health, 
performance bottlenecks, and operational efficiency.

This module is particularly valuable for system administrators, web developers, 
and IT professionals tasked with overseeing Apache web servers. Its easy setup 
and integration with the [ELK Stack](https://logit.io/blog/post/elk-stack-guide/) 
empower users with real-time monitoring, advanced analytics, and visualization 
capabilities, significantly surpassing the scope of traditional monitoring tools.

Compared to other monitoring approaches that might utilize proprietary 
formats or offer limited adaptability, the Metricbeat Module for Apache 
is designed for ease of use, detailed analysis, and efficient 
troubleshooting within Apache server environments.

Our platform extends comprehensive support for the Metricbeat Module for 
Apache, offering centralized management of metrics for simplified analysis 
and proactive monitoring. This support effectively removes the hurdles of 
manually collecting and analyzing metrics across distributed Apache server setups.

Should you need assistance with configuring the Metricbeat Module for 
Apache or have any queries about how to effectively monitor your Apache 
servers, the Logit.io team is here to help. We encourage you to visit
