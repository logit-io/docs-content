Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that helps you monitor Docker by collecting 
metrics from the containers running on the host system. Configure Metricbeat 
using the pre-defined examples below to collect and ship Docker container 
service metrics and statistics to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Metricbeat

  <InstallMetricbeat />

  ### Copy Configuration File

  <MetricbeatOutput />

  ### Enable module

  <EnableMetricbeatModule module="docker" />

  ### Configure Module

  Each module has its own configuration file where different metricsets can be enabled / disabled. 
  Locate the configuration file for the docker module (`docker.yml`) which will be in the __modules.d__ subfolder
  where you installed Metricbeat.
  
  The following metricsets can be enabled (they will be disabled by default). 
  To enable or disable a metricset simply comment or uncomment the line out.
  All of the metricsets except for `image` are enabled in the example below:
  
  ```yml copy showLineNumbers
  metricbeat.modules:
  - module: docker
    metricsets:
      - "container"
      - "cpu"
      - "diskio"
      - "event"
      - "healthcheck"
      - "info"
      #- "image"
      - "memory"
      - "network"
    hosts: ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
    period: 10s
    enabled: true
  ```

  ### Start Metricbeat

  <StartBeat beatname="metricbeat" />

  ### Check Logit.io for your metrics
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="metrics" utmCampaign="docker_metricbeat" source="metrics_docker" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### Compatibility & configuration notes

  The Docker module is currently tested on Linux and Mac with the community edition engine, 
  versions `1.11` and `17.09.0-ce`. It is not tested on Windows, but it should also work there.
        
  It is strongly recommended that you run Docker metricsets with a period that is 3 seconds or longer. 
  The request to the Docker API already takes up to 2 seconds. Specifying less than 3 seconds 
  will result in requests that timeout, and no data will be reported for those requests.
