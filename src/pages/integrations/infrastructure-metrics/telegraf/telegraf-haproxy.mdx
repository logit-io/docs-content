Configure Telegraf to ship HAproxy metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics of HAProxy, via stats socket or http endpoints
  [[inputs.haproxy]]
    ## List of stats endpoints. Metrics can be collected from both http and socket
    ## endpoints. Examples of valid endpoints:
    ##   - http://myhaproxy.com:1936/haproxy?stats
    ##   - https://myhaproxy.com:8000/stats
    ##   - socket:/run/haproxy/admin.sock
    ##   - /run/haproxy/*.sock
    ##   - tcp://127.0.0.1:1936
    ##
    ## Server addresses not starting with 'http://', 'https://', 'tcp://' will be
    ## treated as possible sockets. When specifying local socket, glob patterns are
    ## supported.
    servers = ["http://myhaproxy.com:1936/haproxy?stats"]

    ## By default, some of the fields are renamed from what haproxy calls them.
    ## Setting this option to true results in the plugin keeping the original
    ## field names.
    # keep_field_names = false

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf HAproxy metrics Overview

HAProxy is a powerful load balancing and reverse proxy solution that plays a critical role in distributed systems. To effectively monitor and 
analyze HAProxy metrics in a distributed environment, organizations require a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an 
open-source metrics collection agent, is the ideal tool for gathering HAProxy metrics from multiple sources, including HAProxy instances, 
operating systems, databases, and applications.

With a wide range of input plugins, Telegraf empowers organizations to collect diverse HAProxy metrics, including connection counts, request 
rates, response times, error rates, and more. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance and health of HAProxy instances, 
enabling organizations to optimize their load balancing infrastructure.

For storing and querying the collected HAProxy metrics, Prometheus, a robust open-source monitoring and alerting tool, is the preferred choice. 
Prometheus supports a flexible querying language and graphical visualization capabilities, enabling organizations to gain actionable insights. 
By configuring Telegraf to output HAProxy metrics in the Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf 
server, seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect HAProxy metrics, formatting them in the Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to 
scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain deep 
insights into load balancing performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf to ship HAProxy metrics to Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable and efficient metrics management solution for 
their distributed environments. This empowers them to monitor HAProxy performance, optimize their load balancing infrastructure, and make 
data-driven decisions to ensure optimal system health and performance.
