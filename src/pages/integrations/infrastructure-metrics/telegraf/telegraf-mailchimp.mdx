### Telegraf Mailchimp metrics Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze MailChimp metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to have a reliable and efficient 
metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is ideally suited for this task. It can gather MailChimp 
metrics from a variety of sources, such as live MailChimp instances, databases, and other related applications.

Telegraf offers a broad array of input plugins, allowing users to collect metrics from diverse sources such as CPU usage, memory usage, 
network activity, and more. To store and query these gathered metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and 
alerting system that supports a flexible querying language and graphical data visualization.

To transmit MailChimp metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This procedure involves organizing Telegraf to collect MailChimp 
metrics and output them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
analyzing the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and data visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics are available in Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source 
platform for monitoring and observability that is fully compatible with Prometheus. It empowers users to create dynamic and interactive dashboards, 
offering a deeper understanding of the metrics data.
