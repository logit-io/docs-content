Configure Telegraf to ship Tengine metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read Tengine's basic status information (ngx_http_reqstat_module)
  [[inputs.tengine]]
    ## An array of Tengine reqstat module URI to gather stats.
    urls = ["http://127.0.0.1/us"]

    ## HTTP response timeout (default: 5s)
    # response_timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf Tengine Overview

Efficient monitoring and analysis of Tengine metrics across a distributed environment require a robust and 
reliable metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent designed for collecting and 
reporting metrics, is perfect for this task. It can gather Tengine metrics from a multitude of sources, 
including operational Tengine instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf boasts a range of input plugins, enabling users to collect diverse metrics such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more. These are essential for understanding Tengine performance. 
To store and scrutinize these harvested metrics, organizations can employ Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

Transmitting Tengine metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves configuring Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format and then setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This involves setting up Telegraf to collect Tengine metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting 
the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
performed using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability 
capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to create dynamic, interactive 
dashboards for a deep dive into the metrics data, offering a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues within the Tengine system.
