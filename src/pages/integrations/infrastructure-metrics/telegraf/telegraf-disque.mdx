Configure Telegraf to ship Disque metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  [[inputs.disque]]  
    ## An array of URI to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
    ## with optional port and password.
    ## ie disque://localhost, disque://10.10.3.33:18832, 10.0.0.1:10000, etc.
    ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
    servers = ["localhost"]
  ```

### Telegraf Disque metrics Overview

To efficiently monitor and analyze Disque metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to adopt a reliable and effective metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, fits this role perfectly, capable of extracting Disque metrics from various sources, 
including operational Disque instances, databases, and other related applications.

Telegraf boasts a diverse range of input plugins, allowing users to collect metrics from numerous sources such as CPU usage, memory consumption, 
network activity, and more. To store and analyze these harvested metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and 
alerting system famous for its flexible querying language and potent graphical data visualization features.

To ship Disque metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then 
use Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Disque metrics, outputting 
them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to pull these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data 
using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics are successfully collected into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. Grafana is an 
open-source platform renowned for its monitoring and observability capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to 
create dynamic and interactive dashboards for a deeper understanding of the metrics data, offering a more comprehensive view of performance trends 
and potential issues.
