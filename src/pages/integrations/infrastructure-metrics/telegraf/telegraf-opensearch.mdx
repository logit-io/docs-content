Configure Telegraf to ship OpenSearch metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Derive metrics from aggregating OpenSearch query results
  [[inputs.opensearch_query]]
    ## OpenSearch cluster endpoint(s). Multiple urls can be specified as part
    ## of the same cluster.  Only one succesful call will be made per interval.
    urls = [ "https://node1.os.example.com:9200" ] # required.

    ## OpenSearch client timeout, defaults to "5s".
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## HTTP basic authentication details
    # username = "admin"
    # password = "admin"

    ## Skip TLS validation.  Useful for local testing and self-signed certs.
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    [[inputs.opensearch_query.aggregation]]
      ## measurement name for the results of the aggregation query
      measurement_name = "measurement"

      ## OpenSearch index or index pattern to search
      index = "index-*"

      ## The date/time field in the OpenSearch index (mandatory).
      date_field = "@timestamp"

      ## If the field used for the date/time field in OpenSearch is also using
      ## a custom date/time format it may be required to provide the format to
      ## correctly parse the field.
      ##
      ## If using one of the built in OpenSearch formats this is not required.
      ## https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/opensearch/supported-field-types/date/#built-in-formats
      # date_field_custom_format = ""

      ## Time window to query (eg. "1m" to query documents from last minute).
      ## Normally should be set to same as collection interval
      query_period = "1m"

      ## Lucene query to filter results
      # filter_query = "*"

      ## Fields to aggregate values (must be numeric fields)
      # metric_fields = ["metric"]

      ## Aggregation function to use on the metric fields
      ## Must be set if 'metric_fields' is set
      ## Valid values are: avg, sum, min, max, sum
      # metric_function = "avg"

      ## Fields to be used as tags.  Must be text, non-analyzed fields. Metric
      ## aggregations are performed per tag
      # tags = ["field.keyword", "field2.keyword"]

      ## Set to true to not ignore documents when the tag(s) above are missing
      # include_missing_tag = false

      ## String value of the tag when the tag does not exist
      ## Required when include_missing_tag is true
      # missing_tag_value = "null"
  ```

### Telegraf OpenSearch metrics Overview

For efficient monitoring and analysis of OpenSearch metrics across distributed systems, it's paramount to employ a robust 
and effective metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent designed for collecting and sending 
telemetry data, is perfectly suited for this role, capable of capturing OpenSearch metrics from numerous sources such as 
operational OpenSearch clusters, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf offers a broad range of input plugins that allow users to gather metrics from a variety of sources like CPU 
usage, memory utilization, network traffic, among others - key for understanding OpenSearch performance. To store and 
sift through these harvested metrics, organizations can turn to Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting 
toolkit celebrated for its flexible querying language and superior data visualization features.

In order to relay OpenSearch metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output 
metrics in the Prometheus format, and then arrange for Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This involves setting up Telegraf to collect OpenSearch metrics, exporting them in the Prometheus format, adjusting 
Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the Telegraf server, and subsequently decoding the data using Prometheus's 
advanced querying and graphical visualization tools.

After the successful integration of metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be undertaken 
using Grafana. A top-tier open-source software renowned for its monitoring and observability functions, Grafana is 
fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to construct dynamic, interactive dashboards for deep-diving into 
the metrics data, providing a holistic understanding of performance trends and potential challenges in the OpenSearch system.
