Configure Telegraf to ship Windows Services metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Input plugin to report Windows services info.
  # This plugin ONLY supports Windows
  [[inputs.win_services]]
    ## Names of the services to monitor. Leave empty to monitor all the available services on the host. Globs accepted. Case sensitive.
    service_names = [
      "LanmanServer",
      "TermService",
      "Win*",
    ]
    excluded_service_names = ['WinRM'] # optional, list of service names to exclude
  ```

### Telegraf Windows Services metrics Overview

For effectively monitoring and analyzing Windows services metrics in a distributed environment, 
it's crucial to utilize a robust and reliable metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source 
server agent recognized for its metrics collection capabilities, serves as an excellent tool for 
collecting Windows services metrics from a wide range of sources, such as active Windows servers, 
databases, and other related software applications.

Telegraf comes equipped with an extensive variety of input plugins, allowing users to amass metrics 
from several sources like CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and more. To store and 
interrogate these gathered metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting system known for its flexible querying language and powerful graphic data visualization.

To transport Windows services metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure 
Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, followed by using Prometheus to scrape these 
metrics from the Telegraf server. This process entails setting up Telegraf to gather Windows services 
metrics and output them in the Prometheus format, arranging Prometheus to fetch these metrics from 
the Telegraf server, and then analyzing and visualizing the data using Prometheus's flexible 
querying and visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully imported into Prometheus, they can be further scrutinized and 
visualized using Grafana. Grafana, an open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability 
capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It provides users the ability to create dynamic, 
interactive dashboards for a deeper dive into metrics data, enabling a more thorough understanding 
of performance trends and potential issues.
