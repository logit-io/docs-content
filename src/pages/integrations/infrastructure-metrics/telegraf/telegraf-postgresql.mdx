Configure Telegraf to ship PostgreSQL metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many postgresql servers
  [[inputs.postgresql]]
    ## Specify address via a url matching:
    ##   postgres://[pqgotest[:password]]@localhost[/dbname]?sslmode=[disable|verify-ca|verify-full]&statement_timeout=...
    ## or a simple string:
    ##   host=localhost user=pqgotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
    ## Users can pass the path to the socket as the host value to use a socket
    ## connection (e.g. `/var/run/postgresql`).
    ##
    ## All connection parameters are optional.
    ##
    ## Without the dbname parameter, the driver will default to a database
    ## with the same name as the user. This dbname is just for instantiating a
    ## connection with the server and doesn't restrict the databases we are trying
    ## to grab metrics for.
    ##
    address = "host=localhost user=postgres sslmode=disable"

    ## A custom name for the database that will be used as the "server" tag in the
    ## measurement output. If not specified, a default one generated from
    ## the connection address is used.
    # outputaddress = "db01"

    ## connection configuration.
    ## maxlifetime - specify the maximum lifetime of a connection.
    ## default is forever (0s)
    ##
    ## Note that this does not interrupt queries, the lifetime will not be enforced
    ## whilst a query is running
    # max_lifetime = "0s"

    ## A  list of databases to explicitly ignore.  If not specified, metrics for all
    ## databases are gathered.  Do NOT use with the 'databases' option.
    # ignored_databases = ["postgres", "template0", "template1"]

    ## A list of databases to pull metrics about. If not specified, metrics for all
    ## databases are gathered.  Do NOT use with the 'ignored_databases' option.
    # databases = ["app_production", "testing"]

    ## Whether to use prepared statements when connecting to the database.
    ## This should be set to false when connecting through a PgBouncer instance
    ## with pool_mode set to transaction.
    prepared_statements = true

### Telegraf PostgreSQL Overview

To efficiently monitor and analyze PostgreSQL metrics across a distributed environment, a reliable and efficient 
metrics management solution is essential. Telegraf is an open-source server agent well-suited for this role, 
capable of gathering PostgreSQL metrics from numerous sources, including operational PostgreSQL instances, 
databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf offers a wide range of input plugins, enabling the collection of various metrics such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more. These are key to understanding PostgreSQL performance. 
To store and analyze these metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting 
toolkit known for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

The process of transmitting PostgreSQL metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves configuring Telegraf to 
output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the 
Telegraf server. This involves setting up Telegraf to collect PostgreSQL metrics, outputting them in the 
Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

After the successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
carried out using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability 
features, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards 
for a deeper dive into the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential issues within the PostgreSQL system.
