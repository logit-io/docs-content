Configure Telegraf to ship Zookeeper metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Reads 'mntr' stats from one or many zookeeper servers
  [[inputs.zookeeper]]
    ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
    ## with port. ie localhost:2181, 10.0.0.1:2181, etc.

    ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
    ## If no port is specified, 2181 is used
    servers = [":2181"]

    ## Timeout for metric collections from all servers.  Minimum timeout is "1s".
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## Float Parsing - the initial implementation forced any value unable to be
    ## parsed as an int to be a string. Setting this to "float" will attempt to
    ## parse float values as floats and not strings. This would break existing
    ## metrics and may cause issues if a value switches between a float and int.
    # parse_floats = "string"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # enable_tls = false
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## If false, skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = true
  ```

### Telegraf Zookeeper metrics Overview

ZooKeeper is a reliable and high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. 
Its ability to provide robust, distributed coordination is pivotal in distributed systems. 
To maximize its capabilities, effective ZooKeeper monitoring and analysis are crucial. 
Telegraf, an open-source server monitoring agent, serves as the ideal tool for collecting ZooKeeper 
metrics and data across various sources, including the ZooKeeper ensemble, operating systems, and databases.

Telegraf's extensive range of plugins allows for comprehensive ZooKeeper monitoring. It gathers a 
wide array of ZooKeeper metrics, such as outstanding requests, server state, followers, syncs, 
and connection counts. These metrics are vital in understanding the health and performance of 
the ZooKeeper ensemble, enabling organizations to enhance their distributed coordination.

Prometheus, an advanced open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, is the preferred choice for 
storing and analyzing the collected ZooKeeper metrics. With its flexible query language and data 
visualization capabilities, Prometheus facilitates deep insights into ZooKeeper operations. 
By configuring Telegraf to convert ZooKeeper metrics into the Prometheus format, and setting up 
Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server, seamless integration is ensured.

By using Telegraf for ZooKeeper monitoring and shipping those metrics to Prometheus, businesses 
establish a reliable and efficient distributed coordination metrics management solution. 
This process empowers them to closely monitor ZooKeeper performance, optimize their distributed 
systems, and make informed, data-driven decisions to ensure optimal system health and performance.
