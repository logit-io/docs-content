Configure Telegraf to ship RabbitMQ metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Reads metrics from RabbitMQ servers via the Management Plugin
  [[inputs.rabbitmq]]
    ## Management Plugin url. (default: http://localhost:15672)
    # url = "http://localhost:15672"
    ## Tag added to rabbitmq_overview series; deprecated: use tags
    # name = "rmq-server-1"
    ## Credentials
    # username = "guest"
    # password = "guest"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    ## Optional request timeouts
    ##
    ## ResponseHeaderTimeout, if non-zero, specifies the amount of time to wait
    ## for a server's response headers after fully writing the request.
    # header_timeout = "3s"
    ##
    ## client_timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this client.
    ## Includes connection time, any redirects, and reading the response body.
    # client_timeout = "4s"

    ## A list of nodes to gather as the rabbitmq_node measurement. If not
    ## specified, metrics for all nodes are gathered.
    # nodes = ["rabbit@node1", "rabbit@node2"]

    ## A list of queues to gather as the rabbitmq_queue measurement. If not
    ## specified, metrics for all queues are gathered.
    ## Deprecated in 1.6: Use queue_name_include instead.
    # queues = ["telegraf"]

    ## A list of exchanges to gather as the rabbitmq_exchange measurement. If not
    ## specified, metrics for all exchanges are gathered.
    # exchanges = ["telegraf"]

    ## Metrics to include and exclude. Globs accepted.
    ## Note that an empty array for both will include all metrics
    ## Currently the following metrics are supported: "exchange", "federation", "node", "overview", "queue"
    # metric_include = []
    # metric_exclude = []

    ## Queues to include and exclude. Globs accepted.
    ## Note that an empty array for both will include all queues
    # queue_name_include = []
    # queue_name_exclude = []

    ## Federation upstreams to include and exclude specified as an array of glob
    ## pattern strings.  Federation links can also be limited by the queue and
    ## exchange filters.
    # federation_upstream_include = []
    # federation_upstream_exclude = []

### Telegraf RabbitMQ metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze RabbitMQ metrics in a distributed environment, organizations require a 
reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, 
is well-equipped to gather RabbitMQ metrics from various sources, including queue lengths, message rates, and node-specific statistics.

With its wide range of input plugins, Telegraf enables organizations to collect diverse RabbitMQ metrics, 
such as message rate, message latency, node memory usage, and more. These metrics provide valuable insights 
into the operational health and efficiency of RabbitMQ-based messaging systems, enabling organizations to 
optimize their infrastructure and application management processes.

For storing and querying the collected RabbitMQ metrics, Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring 
and alerting tool, is the preferred choice. Prometheus supports a flexible querying language and 
graphical visualization capabilities, allowing organizations to gain actionable insights from RabbitMQ performance metrics.

By configuring Telegraf to output RabbitMQ metrics in the Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus 
to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server, seamless integration is achieved. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect RabbitMQ metrics, formatting them in the 
Prometheus format, and configuring Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server. 
Leveraging Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain 
deep insights into RabbitMQ performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

Using Telegraf to ship RabbitMQ metrics to Prometheus provides a reliable and efficient metrics management 
solution for distributed environments. This empowers organizations to monitor RabbitMQ performance, 
optimize their messaging systems, and make data-driven decisions to ensure optimal system health and performance.
