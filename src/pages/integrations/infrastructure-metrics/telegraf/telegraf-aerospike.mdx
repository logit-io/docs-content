Configure Telegraf to ship Aerospike metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read stats from aerospike server(s)
  [[inputs.aerospike]]
    ## Aerospike servers to connect to (with port)
    ## This plugin will query all namespaces the aerospike
    ## server has configured and get stats for them.
    servers = ["localhost:3000"]

    # username = "telegraf"
    # password = "pa$$word"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # enable_tls = false
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    # tls_name = "tlsname"
    ## If false, skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = true

    # Feature Options
    # Add namespace variable to limit the namespaces executed on
    # Leave blank to do all
    # disable_query_namespaces = true # default false
    # namespaces = ["namespace1", "namespace2"]

    # Enable set level telemetry
    # query_sets = true # default: false
    # Add namespace set combinations to limit sets executed on
    # Leave blank to do all sets
    # sets = ["namespace1/set1", "namespace1/set2", "namespace3"]

    # Histograms
    # enable_ttl_histogram = true # default: false
    # enable_object_size_linear_histogram = true # default: false

    # by default, aerospike produces a 100 bucket histogram
    # this is not great for most graphing tools, this will allow
    # the ability to squash this to a smaller number of buckets
    # To have a balanced histogram, the number of buckets chosen
    # should divide evenly into 100.
    # num_histogram_buckets = 100 # default: 10
  ```

### Telegraf Aerospike Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze Aerospike metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential to 
leverage a powerful and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, the open-source server agent for collecting 
and sending telemetry data, is an ideal choice for this task. It can gather Aerospike metrics from a variety of 
sources, such as operational Aerospike clusters, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf is equipped with a wide array of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from diverse sources 
including CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and more, all critical to comprehending Aerospike 
performance. For storing and inspecting these gathered metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and strong data visualization capabilities.

To transmit Aerospike metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process 
involves setting up Telegraf to collect Aerospike metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring 
Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using 
Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be executed 
using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform for monitoring and observability, is fully compatible with 
Prometheus. It permits users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look into the metrics data, 
providing a thorough understanding of performance trends and potential issues in the Aerospike system.
