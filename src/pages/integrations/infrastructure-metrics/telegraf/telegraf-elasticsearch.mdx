Configure Telegraf to ship Elasticsearch metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  [[inputs.elasticsearch]]
    ## specify a list of one or more Elasticsearch servers
    ## you can add username and password to your url to use basic authentication:
    ## servers = ["http://user:pass@localhost:9200"]
    servers = ["http://localhost:9200"]

    ## Timeout for HTTP requests to the elastic search server(s)
    http_timeout = "5s"

    ## When local is true (the default), the node will read only its own stats.
    ## Set local to false when you want to read the node stats from all nodes
    ## of the cluster.
    local = true

    ## Set cluster_health to true when you want to obtain cluster health stats
    cluster_health = false

    ## Adjust cluster_health_level when you want to obtain detailed health stats
    ## The options are
    ##  - indices (default)
    ##  - cluster
    # cluster_health_level = "indices"

    ## Set cluster_stats to true when you want to obtain cluster stats.
    cluster_stats = false

    ## Only gather cluster_stats from the master node. To work this require local = true
    cluster_stats_only_from_master = true

    ## Indices to collect; can be one or more indices names or _all
    ## Use of wildcards is allowed. Use a wildcard at the end to retrieve index names that end with a changing value, like a date.
    indices_include = ["_all"]

    ## One of "shards", "cluster", "indices"
    ## Currently only "shards" is implemented
    indices_level = "shards"

    ## node_stats is a list of sub-stats that you want to have gathered. Valid options
    ## are "indices", "os", "process", "jvm", "thread_pool", "fs", "transport", "http",
    ## "breaker". Per default, all stats are gathered.
    # node_stats = ["jvm", "http"]

    ## HTTP Basic Authentication username and password.
    # username = ""
    # password = ""

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    ## Sets the number of most recent indices to return for indices that are configured with a date-stamped suffix.
    ## Each 'indices_include' entry ending with a wildcard (*) or glob matching pattern will group together all indices that match it, and ## sort them by the date or number after the wildcard. Metrics then are gathered for only the 'num_most_recent_indices' amount of most ## recent indices.
    # num_most_recent_indices = 0
  ```

### Telegraf Elasticsearch metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Elasticsearch metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to leverage a dependable and efficient 
metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is an excellent choice for this task, capable of collecting 
Elasticsearch metrics from a variety of sources, including operational Elasticsearch clusters, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf offers a diverse range of input plugins, enabling users to gather metrics from a multitude of sources, such as CPU usage, memory 
consumption, network activity, and more. To store and interrogate these collected metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting system known for its flexible querying language and robust graphical data visualization capabilities.

To ship Elasticsearch metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Elasticsearch 
metrics and output them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
analyzing the data using Prometheus's flexible querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics have been successfully ingested into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be performed using Grafana. Grafana is 
an open-source platform renowned for its monitoring and observability features, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards, offering a deeper understanding of the metrics data and a more comprehensive grasp of performance trends 
and potential issues.
