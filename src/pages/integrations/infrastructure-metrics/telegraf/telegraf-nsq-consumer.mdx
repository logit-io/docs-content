Configure Telegraf to ship NSQ Consumer metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics from NSQD topic(s)
  [[inputs.nsq_consumer]]
    ## Server option still works but is deprecated, we just prepend it to the nsqd array.
    # server = "localhost:4150"

    ## An array representing the NSQD TCP HTTP Endpoints
    nsqd = ["localhost:4150"]

    ## An array representing the NSQLookupd HTTP Endpoints
    nsqlookupd = ["localhost:4161"]
    topic = "telegraf"
    channel = "consumer"
    max_in_flight = 100

    ## Max undelivered messages
    ## This plugin uses tracking metrics, which ensure messages are read to
    ## outputs before acknowledging them to the original broker to ensure data
    ## is not lost. This option sets the maximum messages to read from the
    ## broker that have not been written by an output.
    ##
    ## This value needs to be picked with awareness of the agent's
    ## metric_batch_size value as well. Setting max undelivered messages too high
    ## can result in a constant stream of data batches to the output. While
    ## setting it too low may never flush the broker's messages.
    # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

    ## Data format to consume.
    ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
    ## more about them here:
    ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
    data_format = "influx"
  ```

### Telegraf NSQ Consumer Overview

For efficient monitoring and analysis of NSQ Consumer metrics across disparate systems, it's crucial to utilize a powerful 
and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, the open-source server agent designed for collecting and sending 
telemetry data, is ideally suited for this role. It's capable of capturing NSQ Consumer metrics from a variety of sources, 
including operational NSQ Consumer instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf offers a broad array of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from diverse sources such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more - key for understanding NSQ Consumer performance. To store and scrutinize 
these harvested metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit recognized 
for its flexible querying language and impressive data visualization capabilities.

To transmit NSQ Consumer metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics 
in Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves 
setting up Telegraf to gather NSQ Consumer metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to 
retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic 
querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be undertaken using 
Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability features, is fully 
compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to construct dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deep-dive into the 
metrics data, offering a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues in the NSQ Consumer system.
