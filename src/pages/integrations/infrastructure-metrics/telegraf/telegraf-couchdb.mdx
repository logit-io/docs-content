Configure Telegraf to ship CouchDB metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read CouchDB Stats from one or more servers
  [[inputs.couchdb]]
    ## Works with CouchDB stats endpoints out of the box
    ## Multiple Hosts from which to read CouchDB stats:
    hosts = ["http://localhost:8086/_stats"]

    ## Use HTTP Basic Authentication.
    # basic_username = "telegraf"
    # basic_password = "p@ssw0rd"
  ```

### Telegraf CouchDB metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze CouchDB metrics in a distributed environment, organizations require a reliable and efficient metrics 
management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is the ideal tool for gathering CouchDB metrics from various sources, 
including CouchDB instances, operating systems, and applications.

With a wide range of input plugins, Telegraf empowers organizations to collect diverse CouchDB metrics, such as database size, document count, 
read/write operations, latency, and more. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance and health of CouchDB deployments, 
enabling organizations to optimize their database operations.

For storing and querying the collected CouchDB metrics, Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting tool, is the preferred 
choice. Prometheus supports a flexible querying language and graphical visualization capabilities, allowing organizations to gain actionable 
insights from CouchDB metrics. By configuring Telegraf to output CouchDB metrics in the Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus to scrape 
the metrics from the Telegraf server, seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect CouchDB metrics, formatting them in the Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to 
scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain deep 
insights into CouchDB performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf to ship CouchDB metrics to Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable and efficient metrics management solution for 
their distributed environments. This empowers them to monitor CouchDB performance, optimize database operations, and make data-driven decisions 
to ensure optimal system health and performance.
