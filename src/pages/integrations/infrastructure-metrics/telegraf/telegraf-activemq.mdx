Configure Telegraf to ship ActiveMQ metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash. 
This integration allows you to configure a Telegraf

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

### Install Telegraf

<InstallTelegraf />

### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

```yaml copy
# Gather ActiveMQ metrics
[[inputs.activemq]]
  ## ActiveMQ WebConsole URL
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8161"

  ## Required ActiveMQ Endpoint
  ##   deprecated in 1.11; use the url option
  # server = "192.168.50.10"
  # port = 8161

  ## Credentials for basic HTTP authentication
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "admin"

  ## Required ActiveMQ webadmin root path
  # webadmin = "admin"

  ## Maximum time to receive response.
  # response_timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
```

### Telegraf ActiveMQ metrics Overview

In order to efficiently monitor and analyze ActiveMQ metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to deploy a reliable and proficient 
metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is an excellent tool for this purpose, capable of harvesting 
ActiveMQ metrics from various sources, including operational ActiveMQ instances, databases, and other associated applications.

Telegraf boasts a wide array of input plugins, empowering users to gather metrics from diverse sources such as CPU usage, memory consumption, 
network activity, and more. To store and interrogate these collected metrics, organizations can turn to Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting system, acclaimed for its flexible querying language and powerful graphical data visualization capabilities.

To transport ActiveMQ metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then arrange for Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process includes configuring Telegraf to collect ActiveMQ 
metrics and output them in the Prometheus format, setting up Prometheus to fetch these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then analyzing and 
visualizing the data using Prometheus's versatile querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics have been successfully collected into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be undertaken using Grafana. Grafana 
is an open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability, fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to craft dynamic, 
interactive dashboards, providing a more profound understanding of metrics data.
