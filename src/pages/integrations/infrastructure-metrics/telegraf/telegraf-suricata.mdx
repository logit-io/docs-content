Configure Telegraf to ship Suricata metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Suricata stats and alerts plugin
  [[inputs.suricata]]
    ## Source
    ## Data sink for Suricata stats log. This is expected to be a filename of a
    ## unix socket to be created for listening.
    source = "/var/run/suricata-stats.sock"

    ## Delimiter
    ## Used for flattening field keys, e.g. subitem "alert" of "detect" becomes
    ## "detect_alert" when delimiter is "_".
    delimiter = "_"

    ## Metric version
    ## Version 1 only collects stats and optionally will look for alerts if
    ## the configuration setting alerts is set to true.
    ## Version 2 parses any event type message by default and produced metrics
    ## under a single metric name using a tag to differentiate between event
    ## types. The timestamp for the message is applied to the generated metric.
    ## Additional tags and fields are included as well.
    # version = "1"

    ## Alerts
    ## In metric version 1, only status is captured by default, alerts must be
    ## turned on with this configuration option. This option does not apply for
    ## metric version 2.
    # alerts = false
  ```

### Telegraf Suricata Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Bond metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to utilize a 
reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting 
metrics, is perfectly suited for this task, able to gather Bond metrics from a variety of sources, 
including operational Bond instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf offers a comprehensive range of input plugins, permitting users to accumulate metrics from 
different sources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network activity, and more. To store and 
scrutinize these collected metrics, organizations can implement Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting tool known for its flexible querying language and robust graphical data visualization capabilities.

To transport Bond metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations should configure Telegraf to 
output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the 
Telegraf server. This process involves establishing Telegraf to collect Bond metrics, rendering them 
in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, 
and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and data visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully imported into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
carried out using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform celebrated for its monitoring and 
observability capabilities, and it is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to build dynamic, 
interactive dashboards for a deeper understanding of the metrics data, offering a comprehensive view of performance trends and potential issues.
