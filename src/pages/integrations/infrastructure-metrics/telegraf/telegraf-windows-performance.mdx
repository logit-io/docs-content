Configure Telegraf to ship Windows Performance metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy

  # Windows Performance Counters plugin.
  # These are the recommended method of monitoring system metrics on windows,
  # as the regular system plugins (inputs.cpu, inputs.mem, etc.) rely on WMI,
  # which utilize more system resources.

### Telegraf Windows Performance metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Windows performance metrics in a distributed environment, organizations 
require a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection 
agent, is the ideal tool for gathering Windows performance metrics from various sources, including CPU 
usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network traffic.

With its wide range of input plugins, Telegraf empowers organizations to collect diverse Windows performance 
metrics, such as processor queue length, page file usage, disk read/write speeds, and network packet details. 
These metrics provide valuable insights into the operational health and efficiency of Windows-based systems, 
enabling organizations to optimize their infrastructure management processes.

For storing and querying the collected Windows performance metrics, Prometheus, a powerful open-source 
monitoring and alerting tool, is the preferred choice. Prometheus supports a flexible querying language 
and graphical visualization capabilities, allowing organizations to gain actionable insights from Windows 
performance metrics. By configuring Telegraf to output Windows performance metrics in the Prometheus format 
and setting up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server, seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect Windows performance metrics, formatting them in the 
Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging 
Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain deep insights into system 
performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf to ship Windows performance metrics to Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable 
and efficient metrics management solution for their distributed environments. This empowers them to monitor 
system performance, optimize infrastructure management processes, and make data-driven decisions to ensure 
optimal system health and performance.
