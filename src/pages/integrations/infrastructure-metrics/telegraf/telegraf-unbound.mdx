Configure Telegraf to ship Unbound metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # A plugin to collect stats from the Unbound DNS resolver
  [[inputs.unbound]]
    ## Address of server to connect to, read from unbound conf default, optionally ':port'
    ## Will lookup IP if given a hostname
    server = "127.0.0.1:8953"

    ## If running as a restricted user you can prepend sudo for additional access:
    # use_sudo = false

    ## The default location of the unbound-control binary can be overridden with:
    # binary = "/usr/sbin/unbound-control"

    ## The default location of the unbound config file can be overridden with:
    # config_file = "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf"

    ## The default timeout of 1s can be overridden with:
    # timeout = "1s"

    ## When set to true, thread metrics are tagged with the thread id.
    ##
    ## The default is false for backwards compatibility, and will be changed to
    ## true in a future version.  It is recommended to set to true on new
    ## deployments.
    thread_as_tag = false
  ```

### Telegraf Unbound Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze Unbound metrics in a distributed system, it's crucial to have a robust 
and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is a perfect tool 
for this purpose, able to collect Unbound metrics from a wide range of sources, including operational 
Unbound servers, databases, and other associated applications.

Telegraf comes with an extensive set of input plugins, allowing users to gather metrics from diverse sources 
such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and more. For storing and examining these collected 
metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting system renowned for its 
flexible querying language and advanced graphical data visualization capabilities.

To ship Unbound metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output 
metrics in the Prometheus format, and then establish Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Unbound metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, 
configuring Prometheus to pull these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data 
using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully ingested into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be performed 
using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform well-known for its monitoring and observability capabilities, 
and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to build dynamic, interactive dashboards, providing a 
deeper dive into the metrics data and a more comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues.
