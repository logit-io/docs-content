Configure Telegraf to ship Apache Solr metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read stats from one or more Solr servers or cores
  [[inputs.solr]]
    ## specify a list of one or more Solr servers
    servers = ["http://localhost:8983"]
    ##
    ## specify a list of one or more Solr cores (default - all)
    # cores = ["main"]
    ##
    ## Optional HTTP Basic Auth Credentials
    # username = "username"
    # password = "pa$$word"
  ```

### Telegraf Apache Solr Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Apache Solr metrics across multiple systems, it's vital to have a robust and efficient metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, is ideally suited for this role. It can gather Apache Solr 
metrics from various sources, such as operational Apache Solr instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf features an extensive array of input plugins, allowing users to collect metrics from different sources like CPU usage, memory utilization, 
network traffic, and more. These metrics are key to understanding Apache Solr performance. To store and analyze these harvested metrics, 
organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and impressive data 
visualization capabilities.

To transmit Apache Solr metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Apache Solr 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look at the metrics data, offering a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and 
potential issues within the Apache Solr system.
