Configure Telegraf to ship system metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics about cpu usage
  [[inputs.cpu]]
      ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
      percpu = true
      ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
      totalcpu = true
      ## If true collect raw cpu time metrics
      collect_cpu_time = true
      ## If true compute and report the sum of all non-idle cpu states
      report_active = true

  # Read metrics about memory usage
  [[inputs.mem]]

  # Read metrics about system load & uptime
  [[inputs.system]]
      namepass = ["system"]

  # Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
  [[inputs.disk]]
      ## By default, telegraf gather stats for all mountpoints.
      ## Setting mountpoints will restrict the stats to the specified mountpoints.
      # mount_points = ["/"]

      ## Ignore some mountpoints by filesystem type. For example (dev)tmpfs (usually
      ## present on /run, /var/run, /dev/shm or /dev).
      ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs"]

  [[inputs.diskio]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.processes]]
  [[inputs.procstat]]
      pattern = ".*"
      fieldpass = ["cpu_usage", "memory_rss"]
  ```

  ### Configure the output plugin

  <TelegrafOutputPlugin />

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />

  ### View your metrics
  <LaunchStack source="System_Metrics_via_Telegraf" utmMedium="metrics" utmCampaign="telegraf-system-metrics" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

### Telegraf System Metrics Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze system metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential 
to have a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf is an open-source metrics 
collection agent that can be used to gather system metrics from various sources, 
including operating systems, databases, and other applications.

Telegraf provides a wide range of input plugins that allow users to collect metrics from different sources, 
including CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and more. To store and query the collected metrics, 
organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting system that 
supports a flexible querying language and graphical visualization of data.

To ship system metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations can configure Telegraf to 
output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then use Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server. 
This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect metrics from various sources and output them in the 
Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server, and 
visualizing the data using Prometheus' flexible querying and graphical visualization capabilities.

In summary, using Telegraf to ship system metrics to Prometheus is a reliable and efficient metrics 
management solution for distributed environments. By configuring Telegraf to output metrics in the 
Prometheus format and using Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server, organizations 
can gain insights into system performance and take action to optimize and troubleshoot their distributed systems.
