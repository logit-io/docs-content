Configure Telegraf to ship Fail2ban metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics from fail2ban.
  [[inputs.fail2ban]]
    ## Use sudo to run fail2ban-client
    use_sudo = false
  ```

### Telegraf Fail2ban metrics Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze Fail2ban metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential to employ a trustworthy and 
efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is ideally suited for this task, capable of 
gathering Fail2ban metrics from a host of sources, including operational Fail2ban instances, databases, and other related applications.

Telegraf provides a broad assortment of input plugins, empowering users to collect metrics from diverse sources such as CPU usage, memory 
consumption, network activity, and more. To store and examine these collected metrics, organizations can make use of Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting system renowned for its flexible querying language and robust graphical data visualization capabilities.

To ship Fail2ban metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, and 
then arrange for Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect Fail2ban 
metrics, rendering them in the Prometheus format, setting up Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully transferred into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. Grafana is 
an open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users 
to construct dynamic, interactive dashboards, providing a deeper understanding of the metrics data and a more complete view of performance trends 
and potential issues.
