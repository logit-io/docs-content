Configure Telegraf to ship Jenkins metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read jobs and cluster metrics from Jenkins instances
  [[inputs.jenkins]]
    ## The Jenkins URL in the format "schema://host:port"
    url = "http://my-jenkins-instance:8080"
    # username = "admin"
    # password = "admin"

    ## Set response_timeout
    response_timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use SSL but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    ## Optional Max Job Build Age filter
    ## Default 1 hour, ignore builds older than max_build_age
    # max_build_age = "1h"

    ## Optional Sub Job Depth filter
    ## Jenkins can have unlimited layer of sub jobs
    ## This config will limit the layers of pulling, default value 0 means
    ## unlimited pulling until no more sub jobs
    # max_subjob_depth = 0

    ## Optional Sub Job Per Layer
    ## In workflow-multibranch-plugin, each branch will be created as a sub job.
    ## This config will limit to call only the lasted branches in each layer,
    ## empty will use default value 10
    # max_subjob_per_layer = 10

    ## Jobs to include or exclude from gathering
    ## When using both lists, job_exclude has priority.
    ## Wildcards are supported: [ "jobA/*", "jobB/subjob1/*"]
    # job_include = [ "*" ]
    # job_exclude = [ ]

    ## Nodes to include or exclude from gathering
    ## When using both lists, node_exclude has priority.
    # node_include = [ "*" ]
    # node_exclude = [ ]

    ## Worker pool for jenkins plugin only
    ## Empty this field will use default value 5
    # max_connections = 5
  ```

### Telegraf Jenkins metrics Overview

Jenkins is a robust continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that's vital for streamlining and automating software development 
rocesses. To maximize its capabilities, effective Jenkins monitoring and analysis are paramount. This is where Telegraf, the open-source server 
monitoring agent, comes into play. Telegraf is ideal for collecting Jenkins metrics and data across various sources, including the Jenkins 
server, operating systems, and databases.

Telegraf's diverse range of plugins allows for comprehensive Jenkins monitoring. It collects a broad scope of Jenkins metrics, such as build 
times, job statuses, and queue lengths. These metrics are invaluable in gaining insight into Jenkins server health and performance, enabling 
organizations to enhance their CI/CD pipeline management.

Prometheus, an advanced open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, is the go-to choice for storing and analyzing the collected Jenkins metrics. 
With its flexible query language and data visualization capabilities, Prometheus facilitates deep insights into Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. 
Configuring Telegraf to convert Jenkins metrics into the Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf 
server, ensures seamless integration.

By using Telegraf for Jenkins monitoring and shipping those metrics to Prometheus, businesses establish a reliable and efficient CI/CD metrics 
management solution. This process empowers them to closely monitor Jenkins performance, optimize their software delivery pipelines, and make 
informed, data-driven decisions to guarantee optimal system health and performance.
