Configure Telegraf to ship Mcrouter to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many mcrouter servers.
  [[inputs.mcrouter]]
    ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
    ## with port. ie tcp://localhost:11211, tcp://10.0.0.1:11211, etc.
    servers = ["tcp://localhost:11211", "unix:///var/run/mcrouter.sock"]

    ## Timeout for metric collections from all servers.  Minimum timeout is "1s".
    # timeout = "5s"
  ```

### Telegraf Mcrouter Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze Mcrouter metrics across various systems, it's vital to utilize a robust and efficient metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, the open-source server agent for collecting and sending telemetry data, is ideally suited for this role. It is capable of 
collecting Mcrouter metrics from a wide array of sources, such as operational Mcrouter instances, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf's wide selection of input plugins allows users to collect metrics from diverse sources like CPU usage, memory utilization, network 
traffic, and more, which are crucial for understanding Mcrouter performance. For storing and scrutinizing these collected metrics, 
organizations can employ Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit recognized for its flexible querying language and strong 
data visualization capabilities.

To channel Mcrouter metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process includes setting up Telegraf to gather Mcrouter 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then 
visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to 
design dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look into the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential issues in the Mcrouter system.
