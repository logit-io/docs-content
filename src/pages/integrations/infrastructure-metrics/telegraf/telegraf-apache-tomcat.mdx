Configure Telegraf to ship Apache Tomcat metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Gather metrics from the Tomcat server status page.
  [[inputs.tomcat]]
    ## URL of the Tomcat server status
    # url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/status/all?XML=true"

    ## HTTP Basic Auth Credentials
    # username = "tomcat"
    # password = "s3cret"

    ## Request timeout
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf Apache Tomcat metrics Overview

In order to efficiently monitor and analyze Apache Tomcat metrics in a distributed environment, it's essential to utilize a reliable and 
efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is a perfect choice for this, as it can collect 
Apache Tomcat metrics from a range of sources, including operational Apache Tomcat servers, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf provides a broad array of input plugins, enabling users to amass metrics from diverse sources such as CPU usage, memory consumption, 
network activity, and more. To store and query these collected metrics, organizations can employ Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and 
alerting system that is celebrated for its flexible querying language and powerful graphical data visualization capabilities.

To ship Apache Tomcat metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This procedure involves configuring Telegraf to collect Apache 
Tomcat metrics and output them in the Prometheus format, setting up Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then 
visually analyzing the data using Prometheus's flexible querying and graphical visualization capabilities.

Once the metrics are successfully loaded into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be conducted using Grafana. Grafana is an 
open-source platform well-known for its monitoring and observability capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users 
to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper dive into the metrics data, offering a more comprehensive understanding of performance 
trends and potential issues.
