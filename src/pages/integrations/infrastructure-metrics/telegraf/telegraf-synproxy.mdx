Configure Telegraf to ship Synproxy metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Get synproxy counter statistics from procfs
  # This plugin ONLY supports Linux
  [[inputs.synproxy]]
    # no configuration
  ```

### Telegraf Synproxy Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of Synproxy metrics across a distributed environment, 
it's crucial to have a robust metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent 
for collecting and reporting metrics, is well-suited for this role. It can gather Synproxy metrics 
from various sources, including operational Synproxy instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf features a broad range of input plugins, allowing users to collect diverse metrics such as CPU usage, 
memory utilization, network traffic, and more. These are vital for understanding Synproxy performance. 
To store and examine these harvested metrics, organizations can use Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and potent data visualization capabilities.

To transmit Synproxy metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to 
output metrics in the Prometheus format and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the 
Telegraf server. This involves setting up Telegraf to collect Synproxy metrics, outputting them in 
the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, 
and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Upon successful integration of the metrics into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be 
conducted using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform known for its monitoring and 
observability features, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users to create dynamic, 
interactive dashboards for a deep dive into the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding 
of performance trends and potential issues in the Synproxy system.
