Configure Telegraf to ship MongoDB Server metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many MongoDB servers
  [[inputs.mongodb]]
    ## An array of URLs of the form:
    ##   "mongodb://" [user ":" pass "@"] host [ ":" port]
    ## For example:
    ##   mongodb://user:auth_key@10.10.3.30:27017,
    ##   mongodb://10.10.3.33:18832,
    ##
    ## If connecting to a cluster, users must include the "?connect=direct" in
    ## the URL to ensure that the connection goes directly to the specified node
    ## and not have all connections passed to the master node.
    servers = ["mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?connect=direct"]

    ## When true, collect cluster status.
    ## Note that the query that counts jumbo chunks triggers a COLLSCAN, which
    ## may have an impact on performance.
      gather_cluster_status = true

    ## When true, collect per database stats
      gather_perdb_stats = true

    ## When true, collect per collection stats
      gather_col_stats = true

    ## When true, collect usage statistics for each collection
    ## (insert, update, queries, remove, getmore, commands etc...).
    # gather_top_stat = false

    ## List of db where collections stats are collected
    ## If empty, all db are concerned
    # col_stats_dbs = ["local"]

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    ## Specifies plugin behavior regarding disconnected servers
    ## Available choices :
    ##   - error: telegraf will return an error on startup if one the servers is unreachable
    ##   - skip: telegraf will skip unreachable servers on both startup and gather
    # disconnected_servers_behavior = "error"
  ```

### Telegraf MongoDB Server Overview

For effective monitoring and analysis of MongoDB metrics in a distributed network, companies require a reliable and robust solution for 
managing these metrics. Telegraf, an open-source server agent known for its data collection capabilities, can aggregate MongoDB metrics from 
multiple sources, including active MongoDB instances, databases, and other related applications.

Telegraf provides a wide array of input plugins, enabling users to capture metrics from different facets like CPU utilization, memory 
consumption, network operations, among others. To preserve and analyze these collected metrics, firms can utilize Prometheus, an open-source 
tool famed for its monitoring and alerting capabilities. Prometheus also offers a flexible querying language and striking data visualization 
attributes.

By configuring Telegraf to produce metrics in the Prometheus format and using Prometheus to pull these metrics from the Telegraf server, 
businesses can efficiently export MongoDB metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus. This procedure involves setting up Telegraf to compile MongoDB 
metrics, formatting them in Prometheus's style, organizing Prometheus to extract these metrics from the Telegraf server, and visually 
interpreting the data leveraging Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization features.

Implementing Telegraf to transmit MongoDB metrics to Prometheus presents a dependable and effective metrics management solution for distributed 
networks. It allows organizations to glean insights into MongoDB performance, optimize their dispersed MongoDB instances, and swiftly address 
any arising issues.
