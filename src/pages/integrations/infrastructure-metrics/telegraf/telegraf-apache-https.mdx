Configure Telegraf to ship Apache HTTP Server metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  # Read Apache status information (mod_status)
  [[inputs.apache]]
    ## An array of URLs to gather from, must be directed at the machine
    ## readable version of the mod_status page including the auto query string.
    ## Default is "http://localhost/server-status?auto".
    urls = ["http://localhost/server-status?auto"]

    ## Credentials for basic HTTP authentication.
    # username = "myuser"
    # password = "mypassword"

    ## Maximum time to receive response.
    # response_timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf Apache HTTP Server Overview

For effective monitoring and analyzing Apache HTTP metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to have a dependable and capable metrics 
management solution. Telegraf, an open-source agent for collecting and transmitting metrics, is an ideal choice for gathering Apache HTTP 
metrics from numerous sources, such as live Apache servers, databases, and other applications.

Telegraf provides a broad spectrum of input plugins, allowing the collection of metrics from diverse sources including CPU usage, memory 
consumption, network activity, and more. To store and query these accumulated metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source 
monitoring and alerting system that supports a flexible querying language and graphic data visualization.

To ship Apache metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, then 
utilize Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This procedure involves setting up Telegraf to gather Apache metrics and 
output them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to extract these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then analyzing and 
visualizing the data using Prometheus's flexible querying capabilities.

Once the metrics are in Prometheus, they can be further analyzed and visualized using Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring 
and observability, and it's perfectly compatible with Prometheus. It provides users with the ability to create dynamic and interactive 
dashboards to drill down into the metrics data. This integration provides organizations with a powerful toolset to gain valuable insights into 
Apache performance, enabling them to optimize and troubleshoot their distributed Apache systems effectively.

Using Telegraf to ship Apache metrics to Prometheus, followed by analysis and visualization with Grafana, is a reliable and efficient method 
for managing metrics in distributed environments. This strategy equips organizations with the ability to optimize their distributed systems 
and promptly address any arising issues.
