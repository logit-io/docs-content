Configure Telegraf to ship Redis metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```yaml copy
  -- Read Redis's basic status information
  [[inputs.redis]]
  -- specify servers via a url matching:
  -- [protocol://][:password]@address[:port]
  --  e.g. tcp://localhost:6379 or tcp://:password@192.168.99.100
  -- If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  -- If no port is specified, 6379 is used
    servers = [<protocol>://][:<password>]@<address>[:<port>]
  ```

  Replacing the values for protocol, password, address and port as needed.

### Telegraf Redis metrics Overview

Redis is a high-performance, in-memory data structure store serving as a key-value database, cache, and message broker. 
Monitoring and analyzing Redis metrics are crucial for optimal performance and reliability in distributed systems. 
To achieve this, organizations require a reliable and efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source 
metrics collection agent, excels in gathering Redis metrics from various sources, including Redis instances, operating systems, and applications.

With a wide range of input plugins, Telegraf empowers organizations to collect diverse Redis metrics, 
such as memory usage, CPU utilization, throughput, and latency. These metrics provide valuable insights 
into Redis performance, enabling organizations to optimize deployments and ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting tool, is the recommended choice for storing and 
querying Redis metrics. With its flexible querying language and graphical visualization capabilities, 
Prometheus helps organizations gain actionable insights from Redis metrics. By configuring Telegraf to output 
Redis metrics in Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Telegraf server, seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect Redis metrics, formatting them in Prometheus format, 
and setting up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging Prometheus's advanced 
querying and visualization features, organizations gain deep insights into Redis performance, 
identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf and Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable and efficient metrics 
management solution for Redis deployments. This empowers them to monitor Redis performance, optimize 
resource allocation, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to ensure optimal system health and performance.
