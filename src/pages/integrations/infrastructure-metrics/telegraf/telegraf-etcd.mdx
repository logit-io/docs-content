Configure Telegraf to ship etcd metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

<Steps>
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read metrics from one or many prometheus clients
  [[inputs.prometheus]]
    ## An array of urls to scrape metrics from.
    urls = ["http://localhost:9100/metrics"]
    
    ## Metric version controls the mapping from Prometheus metrics into
    ## Telegraf metrics.  When using the prometheus_client output, use the same
    ## value in both plugins to ensure metrics are round-tripped without
    ## modification.
    ##
    ##   example: metric_version = 1; 
    ##            metric_version = 2; recommended version
    # metric_version = 1
    
    ## Url tag name (tag containing scrapped url. optional, default is "url")
    # url_tag = "url"
    
    ## Whether the timestamp of the scraped metrics will be ignored.
    ## If set to true, the gather time will be used.
    # ignore_timestamp = false
    
    ## An array of Kubernetes services to scrape metrics from.
    # kubernetes_services = ["http://my-service-dns.my-namespace:9100/metrics"]
    
    ## Kubernetes config file to create client from.
    # kube_config = "/path/to/kubernetes.config"
    
    ## Scrape Kubernetes pods for the following prometheus annotations:
    ## - prometheus.io/scrape: Enable scraping for this pod
    ## - prometheus.io/scheme: If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need to
    ##     set this to 'https' & most likely set the tls config.
    ## - prometheus.io/path: If the metrics path is not /metrics, define it with this annotation.
    ## - prometheus.io/port: If port is not 9102 use this annotation
    # monitor_kubernetes_pods = true
    
    ## Get the list of pods to scrape with either the scope of
    ## - cluster: the kubernetes watch api (default, no need to specify)
    ## - node: the local cadvisor api; for scalability. Note that the config node_ip or the environment variable NODE_IP must be set to the host IP.
    # pod_scrape_scope = "cluster"
    
    ## Only for node scrape scope: node IP of the node that telegraf is running on.
    ## Either this config or the environment variable NODE_IP must be set.
    # node_ip = "10.180.1.1"
    
    ## Only for node scrape scope: interval in seconds for how often to get updated pod list for scraping.
    ## Default is 60 seconds.
    # pod_scrape_interval = 60
    
    ## Restricts Kubernetes monitoring to a single namespace
    ##   ex: monitor_kubernetes_pods_namespace = "default"
    # monitor_kubernetes_pods_namespace = ""
    # label selector to target pods which have the label
    # kubernetes_label_selector = "env=dev,app=nginx"
    # field selector to target pods
    # eg. To scrape pods on a specific node
    # kubernetes_field_selector = "spec.nodeName=$HOSTNAME"

    ## Scrape Services available in Consul Catalog
    # [inputs.prometheus.consul]
    #   enabled = true
    #   agent = "http://localhost:8500"
    #   query_interval = "5m"

    #   [[inputs.prometheus.consul.query]]
    #     name = "a service name"
    #     tag = "a service tag"
    #     url = 'http://\{\{if ne .ServiceAddress ""\}\}\{\{.ServiceAddress\}\}\{\{.Address\}\}:\{\{.ServicePort\}\}/\{\{.\}\}metrics'
    #     [inputs.prometheus.consul.query.tags]
    #       host = "\{\{.Node\}\}"
    
    ## Use bearer token for authorization. ('bearer_token' takes priority)
    # bearer_token = "/path/to/bearer/token"
    ## OR
    # bearer_token_string = "abc_123"
    
    ## HTTP Basic Authentication username and password. ('bearer_token' and
    ## 'bearer_token_string' take priority)
    # username = ""
    # password = ""
    
    ## Specify timeout duration for slower prometheus clients (default is 3s)
    # response_timeout = "3s"
    
    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = /path/to/cafile
    # tls_cert = /path/to/certfile
    # tls_key = /path/to/keyfile
    
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf etcd metrics Overview

etcd is a crucial distributed key-value store that plays an essential role in maintaining the configuration data, state data, and metadata for 
distributed systems. To effectively monitor and analyze etcd metrics in a distributed environment, organizations need a reliable and efficient 
metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is the ideal tool for gathering etcd metrics from multiple 
sources, including etcd instances, operating systems, databases, and applications.

With a wide range of input plugins, Telegraf enables organizations to collect diverse etcd metrics, including client traffic, server message 
counts, backend commit times, and more. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance and health of etcd instances, enabling 
organizations to optimize their distributed storage infrastructure.

For storing and querying the collected etcd metrics, Prometheus, a robust open-source monitoring and alerting tool, is the preferred choice. 
Prometheus supports a flexible querying language and graphical visualization capabilities, enabling organizations to gain actionable insights. 
By configuring Telegraf to output etcd metrics in the Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the Telegraf server, 
seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect etcd metrics, formatting them in the Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to scrape 
the metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain deep insights 
into distributed key-value store performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf to ship etcd metrics to Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable and efficient metrics management solution for their 
distributed environments. This empowers them to monitor etcd performance, optimize their distributed storage infrastructure, and make data-driven 
decisions to ensure optimal system health and performance.
