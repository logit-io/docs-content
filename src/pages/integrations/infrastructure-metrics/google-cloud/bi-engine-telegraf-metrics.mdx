## Telegraf Google Google Big Query BI metrics Overview

For efficient monitoring and insightful examination of Google BI Engine metrics across distributed systems, 
the indispensability of a robust and capable metrics management solution is considerable. A fitting option 
for this role is Telegraf, an open-source server agent known for its ability to gather and report metrics 
from Google BI Engine and a myriad of other sources, such as active system instances, databases, and corresponding applications.

Telegraf possesses an extensive range of input plugins, allowing users to collect important metrics such 
as query counts, latency, error rates, and more. These metrics are crucial for understanding the performance 
of the Google BI Engine. For storing and analyzing these gathered metrics, organizations can employ 
Prometheus, a highly respected open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, acclaimed for its adaptable 
query language and strong data visualization capabilities.

Transmitting Google BI Engine metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves setting up Telegraf to produce 
metrics in Prometheus's format, followed by arranging Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further comprehensive analysis and 
visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a prime open-source platform renowned for 
its monitoring and observability features, integrates effortlessly with Prometheus. It allows users 
to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look into the metrics data, providing a 
thorough understanding of performance patterns and potential issues within Google BI Engine.
