## Telegraf Google IOT Core Platform metrics Overview

To ensure effective monitoring and analysis of Google IoT Core deployments, it is important to implement 
a comprehensive metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent, is widely recognized 
for its ability to collect and report metrics from various sources, including IoT device connectivity, 
message ingestion rates, and device activity.

Telegraf offers a variety of input plugins that allow users to collect diverse metrics related to IoT 
Core performance, such as message throughput, device status, and connectivity patterns. These metrics 
provide valuable insights into the health and performance of IoT deployments.

For storing and analyzing these metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting toolkit known for its flexible query language and powerful data visualization capabilities. 
The process of transmitting Google IoT Core metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves configuring 
Telegraf to present metrics in Prometheus's format and instructing Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, organizations can perform comprehensive 
analysis and visualization using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform for monitoring and 
observability, seamlessly integrates with Prometheus, enabling users to create dynamic and interactive 
dashboards to explore IoT Core metrics, identify trends, and optimize IoT deployments.
