## Telegraf Google Dataproc Platform metrics Overview

To ensure effective monitoring and analysis of Google Dataproc clusters across distributed systems, 
implementing a robust metrics management solution is crucial. Telegraf, an open-source server agent, 
is widely recognized for its capability to collect and report metrics from various sources, including 
Dataproc clusters, job execution statistics, resource utilization, and other relevant metrics.

Telegraf offers a comprehensive range of input plugins that allow users to gather a wide variety of 
metrics, providing valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of Google Dataproc. For 
storing and analyzing these metrics, organizations can leverage Prometheus, an open-source monitoring 
and alerting toolkit known for its flexible query language and robust data visualization capabilities.

The process of transmitting Google Dataproc metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus involves configuring 
Telegraf to present metrics in Prometheus's format and instructing Prometheus to scrape these metrics 
from the Telegraf server.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, organizations can perform comprehensive 
analysis and visualization using Grafana. Grafana, a leading open-source platform for monitoring and 
observability, seamlessly integrates with Prometheus, allowing users to create dynamic and interactive 
dashboards to gain deeper insights into Dataproc performance, job execution trends, and potential optimization opportunities.
