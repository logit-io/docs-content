Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Learn how configure syslog-ng to securely ship logs over SSL to your 
  Stack via Logstash. This is a good choice when you need to ship logs from 
  appliances or devices where you cannot run one of the [beats shippers](/integrations/).
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Syslog-ng Configuration

  Add the following additional config into `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/logit.conf`

  ```cmd copy
  destination d_logit {
      network("@logstash.host" port(@logstash.sslPort)
          transport("tls")
          tls( ca_dir("/etc/ssl/certs/"))
      );
  };

  log { source(s_src); destination(d_logit); };
  ```

  ### Restart

  Restart the Syslog-ng service:

  ```bash copy
  sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng
  ```

### Syslog-ng Logging Overview

Syslog-ng is a robust message logging system that is widely used across various operating systems and network devices. It plays a crucial role in sending log 
data to a centralized logging server. IT teams find it invaluable for tasks such as auditing, diagnostics, and enhancing operational efficiency, as it 
records event data using a highly flexible and customizable approach.

Unlike some other logging systems, Syslog-ng offers a higher degree of standardization and control, making it easier to manage and understand log data efficiently. 
This standardization proves particularly advantageous in diverse environments where different devices and systems interact, ensuring that log data remains 
coherent and structured for analysis.

Our Syslog-ng log analyzer provides a powerful solution for the rapid analysis of large volumes of Syslog-ng log data. This tool allows you to swiftly identify 
the root causes of performance issues and helps prevent instances of downtime across your infrastructure. Whether you're dealing with gigabytes or even terabytes 
of log data, our analyzer is designed to handle it effectively.

If you require assistance with migrating your log data to Syslog-ng or optimizing your log management processes, our dedicated support team is here to assist 
you. You can reach out through our Help Center, <IntercomButton text="via live chat" />, or other contact options. We're committed to 
helping you make the most of Syslog-ng for your logging and monitoring needs.
