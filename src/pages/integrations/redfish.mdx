Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Redfish metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>
  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  # Read CPU, Fans, Powersupply and Voltage metrics of hardware server through redfish APIs
  [[inputs.redfish]]
    ## Redfish API Base URL.
    address = "https://127.0.0.1:5000"

    ## Credentials for the Redfish API.
    username = "root"
    password = "password123456"

    ## System Id to collect data for in Redfish APIs.
    computer_system_id="System.Embedded.1"

    ## Amount of time allowed to complete the HTTP request
    # timeout = "5s"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false
  ```

### Telegraf Redfish Overview

For the effective monitoring and analysis of Redfish metrics in a distributed environment, 
a solid metrics management solution is key. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting 
and reporting metrics, is ideally suited for this role. It can gather Redfish metrics from 
various sources, including operational Redfish instances, databases, and other relevant applications.
      
Telegraf offers a comprehensive set of input plugins that enable users to collect diverse metrics, 
such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and more, vital for understanding 
Redfish performance. To store and examine these harvested metrics, organizations can use 
Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit recognized for its flexible 
querying language and potent data visualization capabilities.

The transmission of Redfish metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus requires configuring Telegraf 
to output metrics in the Prometheus format, and then setting up Prometheus to scrape these metrics 
from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Redfish metrics, 
outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from 
the Telegraf server, and then visually interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic 
querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization 
can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana is a leading open-source platform known for its 
monitoring and observability features, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. 
It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper dive into the metrics data, 
offering a comprehensive understanding of performance trends and potential issues within the Redfish system.
