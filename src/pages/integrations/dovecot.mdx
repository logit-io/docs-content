Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Dovecot metrics to your Logit.io stacks.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Read metrics about dovecot servers
    [[inputs.dovecot]]
      ## specify dovecot servers via an address:port list
      ##  e.g.
      ##    localhost:24242
      ## or as an UDS socket
      ##  e.g.
      ##    /var/run/dovecot/old-stats
      ##
      ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
      servers = ["localhost:24242"]

      ## Type is one of "user", "domain", "ip", or "global"
      type = "global"

      ## Wildcard matches like "*.com". An empty string "" is same as "*"
      ## If type = "ip" filters should be <IP/network>
      filters = [""]


  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

### Telegraf Dovecot Overview

To efficiently monitor and analyze Dovecot metrics in a distributed environment, it's crucial to have a reliable and proficient metrics 
management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent designed for collecting metrics, is an excellent tool for this purpose. It can 
amass Dovecot metrics from a multitude of sources, such as operational Dovecot servers, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf provides a broad array of input plugins, allowing users to gather metrics from different sources, including CPU usage, memory 
consumption, network traffic, and more. For storing and scrutinizing these collected metrics, organizations can utilize Prometheus, an 
open-source monitoring and alerting system that is renowned for its flexible querying language and impressive graphical data visualization 
capabilities.

To ship Dovecot metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations should configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, and 
then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process involves setting up Telegraf to collect Dovecot metrics, 
outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and data visualization tools.

After the metrics are successfully imported into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be performed using Grafana. Grafana is an 
open-source platform famous for its monitoring and observability capabilities, and is fully compatible with Prometheus. It enables users to 
create dynamic, interactive dashboards for a deeper understanding of the metrics data, providing a comprehensive view of performance trends 
and potential issues.
