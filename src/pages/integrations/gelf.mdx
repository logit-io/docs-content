Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Configure Gelf logs to automatically send to Logstash and Elasticsearch for further log analysis with our config example below.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Send data to GELF input

  Note: You need a UDP Logstash input on your Stack to be able to send GELF logs.

  Sending the log to logstash with netcat:

  ```cmd copy
  echo '{"test_version": "1.1","test_host":"example.org","short_message":"A short message that helps you identify what is going on","test_level":1,"user_id":9001,"some_info":"foo","some_env_var":"bar"}' | gzip | nc -u -w 1 @logstash.host @logstash.port
  ```

  ### View data

  Take a look in your kibana for your message, note UDP doesnt guarantee delivery

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs
  <LaunchStack utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="gelf" source="gelf" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

### GELF Logstash Overview

GELF (also known as Graylog Extended Log Format) is a convenient log format that was 
originally created to provide an alternative to using [Syslog](/integrations/log-management/protocols/syslog). 
This was done to close the gap between logging in an unstructured 
format versus the more easily processable structured logging format.

GELF uses a simple [JSON](/integrations/log-management/data-types/json) string 
to send structured log messages and application data. Gelf also assists 
in combating the additional shortcomings that become apparent when using 
plain Syslog. As plain Syslog is limited to a length of 1024 bytes there 
is very little remaining space left for backtraces and other payloads. 

Due to its support for structured logging, GELF is highly suitable for 
custom [APM](https://logit.io/platform/observability/application-performance-monitoring/) setups. 
GELF log messages contain the following data fields; host, timestamp, 
version, long and short messages and also provides support for custom 
fields that can be configured as required.

If you need any additional assistance in sending GELF logs 
to [Logstash](/integrations/log-management/shippers/logstash) we're here 
to help, simply get in touch by reaching out to the support team
