Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs

  Configure Filebeat to ship logs from Centos Systems to Logstash and Elasticsearch.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Filebeat

  <InstallFilebeat include={["Red Hat & centOS"]} />

  ### Enable The System Module

  There are several built in filebeat modules you can use. You will need to enable the system module.

  Change directory to the location where filebeat was extracted and run the following commands:

  ```cmd copy
  sudo filebeat modules list
  sudo filebeat modules enable system
  ```

  Navigate to the `modules.d` folder, copy the snippet below and replace the contents of the system.yml module file:

  ```yaml copy
  # Module: system
  # Docs: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.12.2/filebeat-module-system.html

  - module: system
    # Syslog
    syslog:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:

    # Authorization logs
    auth:
      enabled: true

      # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
      # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
      #var.paths:
  ```
  
  ### Update your configuration file

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to send data to your Logit.io Stack via Logstash.

  Copy the configuration file below and overwrite the contents of `filebeat.yml` 
  (this file can be found in the folder where you installed Filebeat in the first step).

  <Callout type="info">
    Filebeat modules offer the quickest way to begin working with standard log formats. 
    If you opt to configure Filebeat manually rather than utilizing modules, 
    you'll do so by listing inputs in the filebeat.inputs section of filebeat.yml. 
    These inputs detail how Filebeat discovers and handles input data. 
  </Callout>
      
  ```yml copy filename="filebeat.yml" showLineNumbers /@logstash.host/ /@logstash.sslPort/
  ###################### Logit.io Filebeat Configuration ########################
  # ============================== Filebeat inputs ==============================

  ### Validate Configuration
    
  <ValidateBeat beatname="filebeat" include={["Red Hat & centOS"]} />

  ### Start filebeat

  <StartFilebeat include={["Red Hat & centOS"]} />

  ### Launch OpenSearch Dashboards to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />

  ### How to diagnose no data in Stack

  <DiagnoseNoData />

  ### (Optional) Update Logstash Pipelines

  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship your system metrics to Logit.io.
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf include={["Red Hat & centOS"]}/>

  ### Configure the plugin

  The default `telegraf.conf` configuration file is thousands of lines long so, for simplicity, we will create a new
  configuration file for this guide.
  Create a new text file and copy the configuration details below into it and save it as `telegraf-demo.conf` in 
  the directory where Telegraf has been installed.

  The configuration below will scrape a selection of system metrics from the machine you have installed Telegraf 
  on and these will be sent to your Logit.io stack. Metrics include CPU, memory and disk usage and system metrics 
  such as system load and uptime.


  ```toml copy filename="telegraf.conf" showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  # Read metrics about cpu usage
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
    percpu = true
    ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
    totalcpu = true
    ## If true collect raw cpu time metrics
    collect_cpu_time = true
    ## If true compute and report the sum of all non-idle cpu states
    report_active = true
  
  # Read metrics about memory usage
  [[inputs.mem]]
  
  # Read metrics about system load & uptime
  [[inputs.system]]
    namepass = ["system"]
  
  # Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
  [[inputs.disk]]
    ## By default, telegraf gather stats for all mountpoints.
    ## Setting mountpoints will restrict the stats to the specified mountpoints.
    # mount_points = ["/"]

    ## Ignore some mountpoints by filesystem type. For example (dev)tmpfs (usually
    ## present on /run, /var/run, /dev/shm or /dev).
    ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs"]
  
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"
  
    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf include={["Red Hat & centOS"]}/>

  ### Launch Metrics to View Data

  Click the 'Launch Metrics' button below to open the infrastructure metrics visualizer. 
  
  <LaunchVisualizer type="metrics" />
  
  Now, as a simple demonstration we will use Grafana to view some metrics data that is being sent to your Logit.io stack. 

  Once Grafana has been opened, click on the Explore option in the left-hand menu:
  ![Grafana Explore](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-explore.png)
  
  Under the Metric header you will see 'Select metric'. Open the drop-down menu 
  and scroll to and select 'mem_available':

  ![Grafana Select Metric](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-metrics-mem.png)

  Click on the blue Run query button near the top-right of the screen:

  ![Grafana Run Query](@/images/integrations/system-metrics/grafana-run-query.png)

  You will now see the metric data displayed and if you click on the blue Run query button this will be updated.
  You can set this to automatically update by clicking on the arrow on the blue button and chosing the interval 
  at which you want the data to be updated.

  When you want to stop Telegraf sending metric data press Ctrl + C in the terminal app / Powershell.

### CentOS Overview

CentOS is a Linux distribution & computing platform that is often compared 
with [Red Hat](/integrations/redhat) Enterprise Linux (RHEL). 

The main difference between the two is that CentOS lacks the high level of 
technical support that is supplied as part of the RHEL package.  

CentOS is built off of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux's open source code 
base, explaining their commonalities and relative compatibility.

Due to this similarity their library versions are identical. This means that 
binaries that work on RHEL will work on CentOS. If you're using their administration 
tools you might notice incompatibilities between the two distributions as 
minor patches are updated at different rates.Large patches & major releases 
for CentOS are released sporadically & infrequently compared to other Linux 
distributions (such as [Ubuntu](/integrations/ubuntu) 
& [Debian](/integrations/debian)).

CentOS users are typically individuals & businesses that don't require strong levels 
of support, certification & training to use this enterprise class Linux distribution successfully. 

Our built in CentOS [log file analyser](https://logit.io/solutions/analysis/log-analysis) is 
included in our [log management platform](https://logit.io/platform/logging/log-management) 
and is built upon the open source tools Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana to ease the processing 
of large amounts of Linux server data for troubleshooting & root cause analysis.

Logit.io can be used to centralise your Linux log 
data & [alerts](https://logit.io/platform/features/hosted-elk/elk-alerting) on errors 
to monitor your operating system (OS). The platform can also be used 
to [view logs](https://logit.io/solutions/log-viewer) within Kibana for 
detailed visualisations & reporting.
   
If you need any assistance with analysing your CentOS logs we're here to help.
