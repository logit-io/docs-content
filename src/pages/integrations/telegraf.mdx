You can find out more about Telegraf in our getting started guide [here](..\getting-started\getting-started-with-telegraf.mdx). 
To learn how to install Telegraf and configure the output plugin to send metrics to your Logit.io stack, follow the steps below. 
You will need to use a specific integration guide for the type of metrics you want to send in order to configure Telegraf.

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Nginx metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  You will set the metrics you want to collect in the Telegraf configuration file (called `telegraf.conf` by default). 
  The configuration file that is installed with Telegraf is thousands of lines long, and supports many different
  input plugins. You can find the recommended inputs configuration in the documentation for the
  type of metrics you want to send. For example, if you are sending Nginx metrics to Logit.io, you can find the 
  instructions [here](..\integrations\nginx.mdx).

  ### Configure the output plugin

  <TelegrafOutputPlugin />

  ### Start Telegraf

  <StartTelegraf />
