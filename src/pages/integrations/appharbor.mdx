  ### Setup

  To send us your logs all you need to do is add this endpoint as a logdrain in your appharbor account:
        
  ```txt copy
  https://@logitApiEndpoint/appharbor?apikey=@apikey
  ```
        
  We automatically parse the logs into a structured format for you so all you need to do is analyse them.

## AppHarbor Logging Summary

AppHarbor is a [.Net](/integrations/dotnet/) multi-tenant platform used to build code, 
run unit tests and subsequently passes accepted code for deployment to their scalable cloud hosted platform. 

The platform allows developers to spend less time distracted by issues that arise 
during the deployment process. This makes the day to day workflow of developers 
faster in order for them to focus on getting back to creating applications and programs.

AppHarbor often requires no additional installation of plugins and custom software 
to run the majority of .Net applications. If additional add-ons are required AppHarbor 
also supports these integrations and provides a marketplace for developers to find the programs they need.

The platform also creates log files, AppHarbor logs contain data related to application 
errors, API changes, load balancer requests, builds and deployment.

AppHarbor allows it's users to view real-time logs within the platform but is limited 
to only storing the last 1500 log lines which are automatically overwritten as new 
entries are created. The Logit.io platform allows users to store AppHarbor logs affordably 
in Elasticsearch and Kibana for ongoing analysis, searching and bringing your 
AppHarbor logs to life in detailed data visualisations.
