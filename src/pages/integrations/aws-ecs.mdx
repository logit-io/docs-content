Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Telegraf ECS/Fargate plugin

  The Telegraf Amazon ECS plugin is Fargate compatible. It uses the ECS metadata and the stats API 
  endpoints to gether stats on the containers in the Task it is configured in.
        
  The telegraf container must be run in the same Task as the workload you with to collect stats for.

  ### Prepare the Configuration file

  You will need to prepare the telegraf-ecs.conf file with the contents of the next step.
        
  As a ECS user you likely already have a solution for loading a configuration file into a container.
        
  For demonstration purposes we will be using a remote configuration file, this would not 
  be the recommended solution for a production environment.

  ### Configure Telegraf

  You can download a copy of the configuration file that you will 
  need [telegraf-ecs.conf](https://cdn.logit.io/telegraf-ecs.conf).

  Or a copy of the configuration file is below.
  ```toml copy showLineNumbers
  [[inputs.ecs]]
    ## ECS metadata url.
    ## Metadata v2 API is used if set explicitly. Otherwise,
    ## v3 metadata endpoint API is used if available.
    # endpoint_url = ""

    ## Containers to include and exclude. Globs accepted.
    ## Note that an empty array for both will include all containers
    # container_name_include = []
    # container_name_exclude = []

    ## Container states to include and exclude. Globs accepted.
    ## When empty only containers in the "RUNNING" state will be captured.
    ## Possible values are "NONE", "PULLED", "CREATED", "RUNNING",
    ## "RESOURCES_PROVISIONED", "STOPPED".
    # container_status_include = []
    # container_status_exclude = []

    ## ecs labels to include and exclude as tags.  Globs accepted.
    ## Note that an empty array for both will include all labels as tags
    ecs_label_include = [ "com.amazonaws.ecs.*" ]
    ecs_label_exclude = []

    ## Timeout for queries.
    # timeout = "5s"

  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "${LOGIT_METRICS_URL}"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

  ### Configure an additional container on your Task Template

  You will need to do this for *each* task you wish to monitor

  Add an additional container to your existing task or as part of your container images

  <Callout type="info">
    You will need to pass the `LOGIT_METRICS_URL` env variable. 
  </Callout>

  *Demonstration configuration only*

  ```cmd copy showLineNumbers
  Name: Telegraf
  Image URI: telegraf:latest
  Environment variables:
    LOGIT_METRICS_URL = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
  Docker configuration - Command:
    "--config", "https://cdn.logit.io/telegraf-ecs.conf"
  ```

## Telegraf AWS ECS and Fargate metrics Overview

Telegraf offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring Amazon ECS and Fargate metrics, 
simplifying the management of containerized environments on AWS. With Telegraf's seamless 
integration with Amazon CloudWatch, users gain access to a rich array of performance data, 
including CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network metrics.

Telegraf automates the collection of these metrics, providing real-time insights into the 
health and performance of ECS and Fargate workloads. Its lightweight, agent-based 
architecture ensures minimal overhead, making it an ideal choice for monitoring containerized 
applications running on AWS infrastructure.

Telegraf's extensible plugin system allows users to easily customize monitoring configurations 
to meet their specific requirements, ensuring flexibility and scalability as their monitoring 
needs evolve. Whether you're managing a small-scale ECS deployment or a complex Fargate 
architecture, Telegraf empowers you to monitor with precision, optimize resource allocation, 
and ensure the reliability of your containerized applications on AWS.
