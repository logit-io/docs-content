Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship Github metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure the Telegraf input plugin

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy
  ### Gather repository information from GitHub hosted repositories.
  [[inputs.github]]
    ## List of repositories to monitor
    repositories = [
      "influxdata/telegraf",
      "influxdata/influxdb"
    ]

    ## Github API access token.  Unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 per hour.
    # access_token = ""

    ## Github API enterprise url. Github Enterprise accounts must specify their base url.
    # enterprise_base_url = ""

    ## Timeout for HTTP requests.
    # http_timeout = "5s"

    ## List of additional fields to query.
    ## NOTE: Getting those fields might involve issuing additional API-calls, so please
    ##       make sure you do not exceed the rate-limit of GitHub.
    ##
    ## Available fields are:
    ##  - pull-requests -- number of open and closed pull requests (2 API-calls per repository)
    # additional_fields = []

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"

### Telegraf Github metrics Overview

To effectively monitor and analyze GitHub metrics in a distributed environment, organizations require a reliable and efficient metrics management 
solution. Telegraf, an open-source metrics collection agent, is the ideal tool for gathering GitHub metrics from various sources, including GitHub 
repositories, events, and user activities.

With its wide range of input plugins, Telegraf empowers organizations to collect diverse GitHub metrics, such as pull requests, issues, code commits, 
repository statistics, and more. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance and collaboration dynamics of GitHub projects, enabling 
organizations to optimize their development processes.

For storing and querying the collected GitHub metrics, Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting tool, is the preferred choice. 
Prometheus supports a flexible querying language and graphical visualization capabilities, allowing organizations to gain actionable insights from 
GitHub metrics. By configuring Telegraf to output GitHub metrics in the Prometheus format and setting up Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the 
Telegraf server, seamless integration is achieved.

This process involves configuring Telegraf to collect GitHub metrics, formatting them in the Prometheus format, and setting up Prometheus to scrape 
the metrics from the Telegraf server. Leveraging Prometheus's advanced querying and visualization features, organizations can gain deep insights into 
GitHub performance, identify collaboration bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By leveraging Telegraf to ship GitHub metrics to Prometheus, organizations establish a reliable and efficient metrics management solution for their 
distributed environments. This empowers them to monitor GitHub performance, optimize development processes, and make data-driven decisions to ensure 
optimal project health and performance.
