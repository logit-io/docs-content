Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>
  
  ### Confirm S3 Bucket

  Ensure your logs are being sent to an S3 bucket. The following guide 
  from Amazon will help you achieve this if you are not doing this already:

  [ELB application to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html)

  ### Ensure Adequate Bucket Permissions

  The following permissions applied to the AWS IAM Policy being used:
        
  - `s3:ListBucket` to check if the S3 bucket exists and list objects in it.
  - `s3:GetObject` to check object metadata and download objects from S3 buckets.
  
  Below is how your permissions should appear (remember to update the bucket name as appropriate):

  ```json copy showLineNumbers
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "SidID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ### Configure Logstash for Amazon ELB Application

  <AddS3Input type="aws_elb_application" stackType="logs" utmMedium="logs" utmCampaign="awselbapplication" input="s3" buttonText="AWS" />

  ### Check Logit.io for your logs

  <LaunchStack source="elb_application" utmMedium="aws" utmCampaign="elbapplication" />
</Steps>

## AWS ELB Application Logging Overview

Sending data to Logit.io from an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Application is an integrated process 
that empowers organizations to gain valuable insights into their applications' performance and security. 

By integrating your Amazon ELB Application with Logit.io, you can effortlessly collect and analyze logs 
and metrics generated by your ELB instances.

Additionally, if you're looking to learn about effective data storage solutions, our [Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)](/integrations/s3) > 
integration is a valuable resource, offering information on Amazon's versatile object storage service that pairs with Logit.io 
for long-term log storage and archival. 

These integrations are seamlessly integrated into Logit.io's [AWS logging](https://logit.io/solutions/aws-logging/) service.
