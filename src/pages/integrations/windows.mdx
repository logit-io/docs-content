This page provides instructions on how to ship your Windows system logs and metrics to Logit.io via Winlogbeat and Telegraf respectively.

Winlogbeat is a Windows-specific event log-shipping agent installed 
as a Windows service. It can be used to collect and send event 
logs to one or more destinations, including Logstash.

Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and reporting metrics.
It is used to collect metrics from various sources, including Windows Performance Counters and Windows Services.

If you are only interested in shipping logs, you can ignore the Metrics section and use the Logs section below.

If you are only interested in shipping metrics, you can skip the Logs section and go straight to the [Metrics](#metrics) section further down the page.

<Steps>
  ## Logs
  
  ### Install Integration

  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Winlogbeat

  <InstallWindowsBeat
    beatname = "winlogbeat"
    version = "8.17.4"
  />

  ### Update your configuration file

  <WinlogBeatConfigFile />

  ### Validate Configuration

  <ValidateWinlogBeat beatname="winlogbeat" />

  ### Start winlogbeat

  From the PowerShell prompt, (in the directory where winlogbeat was installed) run the following command:

  ```ps copy
  Start-Service winlogbeat
  ```

  ### Launch Logs to View Your Data

  <LaunchVisualizer type="logs" />

  ### Install Integration

  ### Install Telegraf

  When you paste the command below into Powershell it will download the Telegraf zip file 
  and then extract that into `C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf-1.33.0`. (You will need 
  to press enter after the initial download command to run the extract command).

  ```ps copy
  wget `
  https://dl.influxdata.com/telegraf/releases/telegraf-1.33.0_windows_amd64.zip `
  -UseBasicParsing `
  -OutFile telegraf-1.33.0_windows_amd64.zip
  Expand-Archive .\telegraf-1.33.0_windows_amd64.zip `
  -DestinationPath 'C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\'
  ```
  Move the telegraf.exe and telegraf.conf files from C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf-1.33.0 
  to the parent directory C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf

  ### Configure the Telegraf input and output plugins

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts. 
  Add the following to the configuration file (i.e. C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf). 
  It includes plugins for both Windows Performance Counters and Windows Services and specifies the output configuration
  for sending your data to Logit.io.

  ```toml copy
  # Input plugin to report Windows services info.
  # This plugin ONLY supports Windows
  [[inputs.win_services]]
    ## Names of the services to monitor. Leave empty to monitor all the available services on the host. Globs accepted. Case sensitive.
    service_names = [
      "LanmanServer",
      "TermService",
      "Win*",
    ]
    excluded_service_names = ['WinRM'] # optional, list of service names to exclude

  ### Start Telegraf

  Run the following command to install Telegraf as a Windows service. 
  ```ps1 copy
  .\telegraf.exe --service install `
  --config "C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf"
  ```
  To test that the installation works, enter the following command:
  ```ps1 copy
  .\telegraf.exe `
  --config C:\"Program Files"\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf --test
  ```
  This will run Telegraf in test mode and output the metrics to the console.
  If you see the metrics output in the console, it means that Telegraf is working correctly.

  To start collecting data run the following command:
  ```ps1 copy
  Start-Service telegraf
  ```

  Once Telegraf is running you should see output similar to the following, which confirms the inputs 
  and basic configuration the application has been started 
  (there will be a lot more lines of output but as long as there are no errors you are good to go):
