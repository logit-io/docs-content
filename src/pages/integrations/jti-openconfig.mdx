Follow the steps below to send your observability data to Logit.io

<Steps>
  ## Metrics

  Configure Telegraf to ship JTI OpenConfig metrics to your Logit.io stacks via Logstash.
  
  ### Install Integration
  <InstallIntegration/>

  ### Install Telegraf

  <InstallTelegraf />

  ### Configure Telegraf

  The configuration file below is pre-configured to scrape the system metrics from your hosts, add the following code to the configuration file `telegraf.conf` from the previous step.

  ```toml copy showLineNumbers /@metricsUsername/ /@metricsPassword/ /@metrics_id/ /@vmAgentPort/
  ### Subscribe and receive OpenConfig Telemetry data using JTI
  [[inputs.jti_openconfig_telemetry]]
    ## List of device addresses to collect telemetry from
    servers = ["localhost:1883"]

    ## Authentication details. Username and password are must if device expects
    ## authentication. Client ID must be unique when connecting from multiple instances
    ## of telegraf to the same device
    username = "user"
    password = "pass"
    client_id = "telegraf"

    ## Frequency to get data
    sample_frequency = "1000ms"

    ## Sensors to subscribe for
    ## A identifier for each sensor can be provided in path by separating with space
    ## Else sensor path will be used as identifier
    ## When identifier is used, we can provide a list of space separated sensors.
    ## A single subscription will be created with all these sensors and data will
    ## be saved to measurement with this identifier name
    sensors = [
    "/interfaces/",
    "collection /components/ /lldp",
    ]

    ## We allow specifying sensor group level reporting rate. To do this, specify the
    ## reporting rate in Duration at the beginning of sensor paths / collection
    ## name. For entries without reporting rate, we use configured sample frequency
    #sensors = [
    #"1000ms customReporting /interfaces /lldp",
    #"2000ms collection /components",
    #"/interfaces",
    #]

    ## Timestamp Source
    ## Set to 'collection' for time of collection, and 'data' for using the time
    ## provided by the _timestamp field.
    # timestamp_source = "collection"

    ## Optional TLS Config
    # enable_tls = false
    # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
    # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
    # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
    ## Minimal TLS version to accept by the client
    # tls_min_version = "TLS12"
    ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
    # insecure_skip_verify = false

    ## Delay between retry attempts of failed RPC calls or streams. Defaults to 1000ms.
    ## Failed streams/calls will not be retried if 0 is provided
    retry_delay = "1000ms"

    ## To treat all string values as tags, set this to true
    str_as_tags = false

  ### System metrics
  [[inputs.disk]]
  [[inputs.net]]
  [[inputs.mem]]
  [[inputs.system]]
  [[inputs.cpu]]
    percpu = false
    totalcpu = true
    collect_cpu_time = true
    report_active = true

  ### Output
  [[outputs.http]]
    url = "https://@metricsUsername:@metricsPassword@@metrics_id-vm.logit.io:@vmAgentPort/api/v1/write"
    data_format = "prometheusremotewrite"

    [outputs.http.headers]
      Content-Type = "application/x-protobuf"
      Content-Encoding = "snappy"
  ```

### Telegraf JTI OpenConfig Overview

In order to effectively monitor and analyze JTI OpenConfig metrics across a distributed environment, it's essential to have a robust and 
efficient metrics management solution. Telegraf, an open-source server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, fits this requirement well. 
It can gather JTI OpenConfig metrics from numerous sources such as operational routers and switches, databases, and other relevant applications.

Telegraf features a wide range of input plugins, enabling users to collect metrics from various sources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, 
network traffic, and more, all critical to understanding JTI OpenConfig performance. To store and scrutinize these collected metrics, organizations 
can utilize Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its flexible querying language and powerful data visualization 
capabilities.

To relay JTI OpenConfig metrics from Telegraf to Prometheus, organizations need to configure Telegraf to output metrics in the Prometheus format, 
and then set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics from the Telegraf server. This process includes setting up Telegraf to gather JTI OpenConfig 
metrics, outputting them in the Prometheus format, configuring Prometheus to retrieve these metrics from the Telegraf server, and then visually 
interpreting the data using Prometheus's dynamic querying and graphical visualization tools.

Once the metrics are successfully integrated into Prometheus, further analysis and visualization can be carried out using Grafana. Grafana, a 
leading open-source platform recognized for its monitoring and observability capabilities, is fully compatible with Prometheus. It allows users 
to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for an in-depth look at the metrics data, providing a comprehensive understanding of performance trends 
and potential issues in the JTI OpenConfig system.
