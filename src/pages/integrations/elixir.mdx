Use OpenTelemetry to easily send Elixir traces to your Logit.io Stack.

  ## APM
  ### Install Integration

    You can get help Getting Started with OpenTelemetry for Elixir by referring 
    to the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/getting-started/). 
    You need to configure the OTLP exporter to ensure the trace data reaches your Logit.io Stack.

    OTLP HTTP/S Exporter settings:

    ```elixir copy showLineNumbers /@opentelemetry.endpointAddress/ /@opentelemetry.httpsPort/ /@opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString/
    config :opentelemetry_exporter,
    otlp_protocol: :http_protobuf,
    otlp_endpoint: "https://@opentelemetry.endpointAddress:@opentelemetry.httpsPort",
    otlp_headers: [{"authorization", "Basic @opentelemetry.base64encodedAuthString" }]
    ```

    For more information about exporter configuration with Elixir please see the 
    [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/exporters/).
