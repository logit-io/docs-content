# What is Logit.io?

Logit.io is a data observability platform that allows you to centralise and analyse your logs, 
metrics and traces from various sources such as applications, servers, and cloud platforms. 
Our platform provides real-time data analysis, powerful search capabilities, custom dashboards, 
and alerts for issues and anomalies.

Here's how the 14-day free trial works:
- You can create up to 3 production-ready OpenSearch and Grafana Stacks in your trial.
- Fully featured with no maximum daily volume or data retention limits, allowing you to send as much data as you need.
- No credit card required.
- After your free trial ends, begin using Logit.io starting from [$9 per month.](https://logit.io/pricing/logs/)

Each fully managed stack can include services for Log Management, Infrastructure Metrics and Tracing / Application Performance Monitoring.
