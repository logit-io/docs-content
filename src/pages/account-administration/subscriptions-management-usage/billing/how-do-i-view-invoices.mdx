# How do I view my invoices?

You can access your Logit.io invoices from your Dashboard, providing you 
have the correct permissions ('Owners' 'Administrators' or 'Billing' Teams).

You can download copies of your invoices by selecting 'Account Settings' 
and then clicking on the 'Billing' option on the side menu.
