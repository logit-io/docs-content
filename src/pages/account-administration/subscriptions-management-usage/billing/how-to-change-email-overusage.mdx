# Can I change the email for overusage emails?

## How to manage who receives emails for overusage

Overusage emails are sent to Account Administrators and Owners by default. 
You can view the Account Administrators and Owners by choosing `Help & Support > Account Administrators`.

Currently the best way to change which people receive email notifications 
for overusage is to use Manage Teams and create a new team with the 
required users, and assign them the required permissions.
