# How to Change the Email for Invoicing

## Working with Invoices and Managing Teams/Users

To find your invoices, navigate to the menu of the far left side of 
the page, you will see 'Invoices' under 'Account Settings'. If you 
wish to change which email address receives invoices, find the 
'Manage Team' section, below 'Manage Users' on the far left of your 
screen. From here you can assign members of your team access to 
specific sections of your account.

For this example, you can assign a different member of your team as the 
'Billing Administrator' which will allow them to manage payments details, 
subscriptions and access invoices.

If you wish to change the email that receives invoices to someone outside 
of your team or a separate email, then engaging a member of your team who is 
included within the account Owners group is required. This is an additional 
security step that is crucial to make this change for compliance reasons.
