# How to resize your stack

## Stacks in Logit.io

Depending on your current plan, you can locate your stack under any of the following 
options within your dashboard; 'Log Management', 'Infrastructure Metrics', and 
'Application Performance Monitoring (APM)'. Once you have selected an option, you can 
view your entire stack for each of the headings. It's not uncommon that during monitoring 
you can experience fluctuations in the data you process. A typical example of this is a 
surge in traffic. Below is an example of a Log Management stack in Logit.io.

## Working with your stack in Logit.io for resizing

If you are experiencing fluctuations in the amount of data that you are processing 
there are two options available to you. Firstly, if you are experiencing increased 
traffic that will have only a short-term impact and will resort to its usual state 
in a short amount of time. Then you don't have to do anything, all of Logit.io's 
stacks will automatically scale up or down to accommodate the change in data and 
once this period has passed, your stack will resize to the original size. 
This ensures that no data is lost.

Your other option is 
to [increase the limits and/or retention period of your stack](/account-administration/subscriptions-management-usage/accounts/plan-resizing-options). 
This is a good option if your organization is growing fairly quickly and you 
believe this increase in data will remain increasing. If you believe this 
applies to you, you can update your stack subscription from your account 
to increase your retention and data ingestion limits.
