# How can I pay for a different plan for each stack

## Updating Your Plan

To locate your plan, you can select 'account settings' from the left 
side menu, and then select 'plan'. You will arrive at a page that 
details your current subscription, including your number of 
stacks and the costs associated with each stack.

Below this initial summary, you will find the list of your individual stacks. 
If you have multiple stacks you can see the current limit and retention 
period for each of your stacks. If you wish, you can change these individual stacks' 
current plans to have a different data limit or retention period. 
You do not need to have the same plan across all of your stacks.

## Payment Methods

Ingestion pipelines can be found as the first box from the left under 
the Application Performance Monitoring (APM) section. This will 
show details about the ingestion pipeline in relation to your APM stack.
 
If you wish to use a different payment method for a specific stack, 
then we advise you to get in contact with us so we can put this 
through for you. Also, additional payment methods are available 
(such as the ability to make a payment via PO) simply reach out to 
support to learn more about these options.
