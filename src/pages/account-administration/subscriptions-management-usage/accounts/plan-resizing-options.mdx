# What are my plan resizing options?

At Logit.io we understand that your logging and metrics needs can change. 
This is why we offer flexibility to tailor your plan to match your changing requirements.
â€‹
You can scale your Logit.io Stacks as required at any time directly from your 
Dashboard. Similarly, if the amount of traffic you send decreases you can also 
reduce your plan from the Dashboard to match your volume and 
retention requirements.

## To resize your plan from the Dashboard:

1. Sign in to your Logit.io Dashboard

2. Click 'Settings' on the Stack that you want to resize

3. Choose the Overview page under Logs, Metrics or Tracing

4. Choose Change Plan/Resize Stack

5. Change your Daily Log Size and/or Retention and click the 
'Confirm Resize' button (as shown below).

Over usage protection is included in your plan should the volume of data 
that you send to Logit.io increase. You may exceed your plan level by up 
to 100% on any three days in a rolling 30 day period. If this is exceeded 
your plan will automatically resize to match the new volume if not resized. 
Logit.io never deletes data that is over your plan limit, so you can always 
access all of your logs and metrics when you might need them most. Our 
engineers will always work with you to find the correct plan for your needs.

If after resizing your plan to match any new data requirements there is a 
need to resize again, simply resize your Stack as needed. Perhaps the volume 
of data you send to Logit.io has returned to previous volume levels and you 
want to put the plan back to its original size, no problem. You can change 
your plan level at any time as long as you have not exceeded 
your plan in the past 30 days.

Monthly resizing allows you to select a suitable plan and you can use 
our [Plans and Pricing](https://logit.io/pricing/logs/) page for clear 
visibility of the price based on the required volume and retention. All plans 
are prepaid for the month, and any increases will be pro-rata 
for the remaining days in the current month.
