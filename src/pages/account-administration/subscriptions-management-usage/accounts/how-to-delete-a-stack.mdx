# How to delete a Logit.io Logs, Metrics or APM Stack

## Step 1: Accessing the Logit.io Dashboard

Begin by accessing the Logit.io dashboard, which is the central hub for 
managing your log data and stacks. You can log in to your Logit.io 
account and navigate to the dashboard.

## Step 2: Viewing Stacks

Once you're in the Logit.io dashboard, locate and select the "View" option. 
This action will lead you to a new screen where you can access various 
options related to your stacks.

## Step 3: Managing Your Stack

In the "Subscription Overview" section, you will find an option called 
"Manage Stack." Click on this option to access Stack management. 
This is where you can control various aspects of your Stacks, 
including the option to delete them.

## Step 4: Deleting Logs, Metrics, or APM

Depending on the specific Stack you wish to delete, you will be presented 
with different options. In this step, you will need to scroll down to 
find the appropriate option, which might be "Delete Logs," "Delete Metrics," 
or "Delete APM," based on the type of data associated with the stack you 
intend to remove. This choice allows you to delete the logs, metrics, or 
application performance data stored in the Stack.

## Step 5: Providing a Reason

Before you proceed with the deletion, Logit.io values user feedback and encourages 
you to provide a reason for deleting the stack. This step helps Logit.io's 
support team understand your needs and any issues you may have encountered. 
Select or enter a brief explanation on why you are deleting the stack.

## Step 6: Confirming Stack Deletion

After providing a reason, you will be directed to the next screen. 
Here, you will need to re-enter the name of the stack you wish to delete. 
This serves as an additional confirmation step to ensure that you are 
indeed deleting the correct stack. Make sure to double-check the stack 
name to confirm your intention to delete the selected stack.

## Step 7: Finalizing the Deletion

Once you've confirmed the Stack name and your decision to delete it, 
proceed with the deletion process. Logit.io will initiate the removal of 
the specified stack along with its associated data, based on your 
selection (logs, metrics, or APM).

By following these steps, you can safely and efficiently manage and 
delete stacks in your Logit.io account while providing valuable 
feedback to the Logit.io support team.
