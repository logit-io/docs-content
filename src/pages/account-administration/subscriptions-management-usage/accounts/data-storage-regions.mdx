# Managing the data storage region for Logit.io Stacks

### Logit.io Account Regions Introduction

When adding a Logit.io Stack to your account, you can choose from a number of dedicated data centres across Europe, the US and UK regions to host your Stack. Selecting the corresponding storage region for your geographic area allows you to ensure that data is being processed in compliance with your specific regional data guidelines and meet any local compliance requirements.
Your choice of data centre is not limited by your own geographic location as we also enable our users to choose to create an account with their data hosted in any of the regions cited above, regardless of where you or your systems reside.

### Viewing the current Region for an existing Account

To view the region setting for your current account select Account Settings from your dashboard, located in the left-hand menu. The region selected for the account is displayed in the account profile, located within the overview section.

### Setting the Region for your Account

The storage region is an account-level setting, this means that when you create your first Stack on an account, the region selected will become the default for that account.
Any subsequent Stacks that are added to the account will also be added to the default account region. If you require Stacks to be hosted in an additional region it is recommended that you create a new account by selecting New Account from the left-hand dashboard menu.

### Adding the first Stack to a Trial Account

When adding the first Stack to a Trial account, you have the option to select the storage region for the Stack as shown above. If you need to change your storage region within your 14-day trial period you can delete the current Stack and add a new one to choose a new default storage region.
To quickly view the Region of a specific Stack, choose Stack Settings > Overview and from here you can see which Region the current Stack is currently deployed to.
