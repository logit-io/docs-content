# What happens at the end of my trial?

What happens when your trial ends depends on how 
far you got setting up your account;

### I haven't added a payment method...

If you've not added a payment method to your account then your stacks 
will be deleted and all associated data sent will be removed.

### I want to restore my stacks at a later date...

In the event that you wish to restore your stacks shortly after the end 
of your trial, feel free to reach out to our engineers via live chat as 
we can restore your data and Stacks.

### I want to carry on uninterrupted...

If you have added a payment method to your trial account then your access to 
Logit.io & your stacks will continue uninterrupted & you'll 
transfer into paying a monthly subscription.
