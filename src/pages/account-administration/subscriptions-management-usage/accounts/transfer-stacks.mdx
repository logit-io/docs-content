# How to transfer Stacks to another Logit.io account?

Transferring Logit.io Stacks from one account to another is a 
straightforward process that can help you consolidate instances 
and streamline your administration. In this guide, we'll walk you 
through the steps to successfully transfer your Stacks 
without experiencing any downtime.

## 1. Preparation:

Ensure you have access to both the source and target accounts.
There is no downtime associated with the transfer process.

## 2. Grant Stack Access:

To enable our support team to transfer the Stacks you will need 
to grant Stack access to Logit.io's support team on both accounts.
Navigate to Your Account, then select Support and from here you 
should be able to select Support Access and enable this on your end. 
From here you can then reach out to the support team at Logit.io 
for us to transfer the accounts on your behalf.

## 3. Stack Permissions:

Be aware that stack permissions won't be transferred during the process.
Owners will need to re-assign permissions as needed once the Stack has been transferred.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, don't 
hesitate to reach out to Logit.io's support team for assistance.
