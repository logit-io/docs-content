# What happens to my data after the retention period has passed?

We understand the importance of providing fine-grained control over your Log Management budgets so you can separate data into value groups for differing retention, usage monitoring, and improved billing management.

The Stack retention setting determines how long logs and metrics are stored and searchable in each Logit.io Stack. You can set the retention to any value allowed in your Stack configuration.

To look more closely at your data retention and usage limits from your dashboard choose Settings > Usage Statistics

After your retention period has passed all of your Stack data is automatically and permanently deleted from all Stack nodes.

### Archiving Data for longer timeframes

In the event that you want to archive your data indefinitely for auditing 
or other purposes, we provide the ability for long-term storage to Amazon 
S3, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

We cover how to do this in our guide to [archiving logs, data and metrics 
after your retention timeframe has ended](/account-administration/subscriptions-management-usage/product/archiving-data-after-retention-timeframe-ended).
