# How can I view my Logit.io ELK stack usage and daily log volume?

### Daily Log Volume

Upon logging into your account, the stack usage dashboard page displays your daily log volume.

You can use this, along with an estimate of the percentage of logs that you have sent us.

### How is Stack Usage calculated?

The Logit.io platform calculates stack usage based on the total disk used for Elasticsearch indexes for a given day.

The values used to display usage in the statistics page are calculated using the max index sizes and data directly gathered from your Elasticsearch stacks.

### Viewing your usage statistics

After logging in, for any stack, choose 'View Stack Settings' > 'Usage Statistics' to dive deeper into your data volumes.

If you have concerns about your usage accuracy, viewing the Elasticsearch \_cat/indices value does give you an indication of how the usage data correlates.

Use the URL below to view your indices.

```
[STACK ID]-es.logit.io/_cat/indices?pretty=true&s=index&v&apikey=[API KEY]
```

### How to use the code

Replace [STACK ID] with your stack id, which can be found in your dashboard.
Replace [API KEY] with your API key, which can be found on your stack settings page.
Open the URL in your browser.
