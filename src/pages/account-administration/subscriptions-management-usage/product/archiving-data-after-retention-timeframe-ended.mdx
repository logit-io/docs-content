# How can I archive my logs, data, and metrics after my retention timeframe has ended?

If you need to keep any logs that you have sent to Logit.io after your stack 
retention period we recommend taking a snapshot of your Elasticsearch indices. 
The snapshot is a backup that can then be stored in Amazon S3 or any similar 
cloud storage service such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. By archiving to 
S3 or similar, also known as cold storage, you can keep your logs beyond your 
stack retention period for as long as you require or indefinitely.

## How to setup S3 index archives for my Logit.io account

If using an S3 account, you simply need to create a bucket with the relevant 
permissions and then raise a request with the support team, we will do the rest. 
Storing/backing up logs and metrics in this way ensures that for auditing and 
regulatory purposes you can restore them to an Elasticsearch instance in the 
future where necessary.

## What is the next step?

If keeping your logs beyond the retention period is something that you require 
from Logit.io or perhaps you have already taken advantage of this service and 
now want to restore a previous snapshot? Please contact our support team who 
will be happy to help guide you through the process.
