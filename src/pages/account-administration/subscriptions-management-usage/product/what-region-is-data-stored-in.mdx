# What region are my Logs, Metrics, and Tracing data stored in?

When incorporating Logit.io into your workflow, you gain the flexibility to choose 
from a range of dedicated data centers located in various key regions across 
Europe, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

This strategic choice empowers you to align your Stack's hosting location 
with your specific geographic requirements, thereby ensuring compliance 
with regional data regulations and local compliance standards.

## Tailored Regional Hosting

Selecting the appropriate storage region for your account holds paramount 
importance as it guarantees that your data processing operations 
adhere to the precise data guidelines of your region.

By matching your geographic area with the corresponding data center, 
you can proactively meet local compliance mandates.

## Global Accessibility

Your freedom to choose a data center is not tethered to your own geographic 
location. Logit.io empowers its users to create an account with data hosted 
in any of the previously mentioned regions, regardless of where you or 
your systems are physically based.

This affords you the capability to craft a data strategy that aligns 
with your specific business needs and compliance objectives.

## Inspecting Your Account's Current Region Setting

To review the regional setting associated with your existing Logit.io account, 
navigate to the Account Settings option located within your dashboard's left-hand 
menu. Here, you will find a comprehensive account profile, which prominently 
displays the region selected for your account. This information is 
accessible within the overview section of your account.

## Establishing the Region for Your Account

It is essential to note that the storage region is an account-level setting. 
Therefore, when you create your first Stack under an account, the region you 
select will automatically become the default region for that account. Subsequently, 
any additional Stacks added to the account will also be hosted in the default account region.

## When Additional Regions are Required

In scenarios where you need to host Stacks in an additional region, we 
strongly recommend the creation of a new account. You can conveniently 
initiate this process by selecting the "New Account" option 
available in the left-hand dashboard menu.
