# Learn how to reduce your log volumes

Sometimes you may receive notifications that you are sending more 
data than your plan allows. If this is unexpected you might want 
to look a bit more closely at the data you're sending, to see if 
there are additional data such as headers that are not required. 
We don't want you sending more data than is necessary!

<Callout type="info">
  OpenSearch does perform compression on the indexes after a 
  period of time, so this can result in the usage figures on the 
  statistics page changing within a 24hr period.

### Break out your data

If you have a single field that contains an entire JSON request, for 
example, you can parse this data into separate fields that contain 
just the values you require. Then you can discard the large request 
field, reducing the total data sent.

In the example below, we are matching a value in the message data 
with a specific pattern. If we find a value that matches the pattern 
we create a field called Duration with this value, all unmatched 
message data will be discarded.

```ruby copy
filter {
  grok {
    match => {
      "message" => "Duration: %{NUMBER:duration}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Remove Headers

Headers can often contain a large amount of data, they are added automatically 
by Logstash when sending data to OpenSearch. If you don't require this, 
you can remove them by adding the following to your Logstash filter before sending to OpenSearch.

```ruby copy
mutate {
  remove_field => ["headers"]
}
```
