# How to add a plugin to Logit.io

Adding a plugin to Logit.io allows you to extend the functionality of your stack. 
Whether you need custom filters, outputs, or other advanced capabilities, 
Logit.io provides a straightforward process to request and incorporate plugins into your stack.

## Request the Plugin

Some plugins are installed by default. To request the addition of a plugin, users 
need to provide a link to the plugin they wish to incorporate to Logit.io's support 
team for review. This link should be accessible and point to the specific plugin's source or repository.

## Logit.io Review

Logit.io's support and engineering team will review the plugin request to ensure 
its compatibility, security, and suitability for your stack.

## Plugin Incorporation

Once the plugin request is approved, Logit.io will incorporate the plugin into 
your stack on your behalf. This may involve adding the plugin's configuration 
settings to the component's configuration file. Our engineers will update you 
when the plugin is available on your stack.

## Testing and Validation

It is important to test the newly added plugin to ensure it functions as expected. 
Validate that data flows correctly and that any custom processing or filtering is applied to your data.

## Support and Assistance

If you encounter any difficulties during the plugin integration process, 
have questions, or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to 
reach out to Logit.io's support team via live chat.
