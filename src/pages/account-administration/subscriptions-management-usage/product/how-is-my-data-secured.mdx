# How can I be sure my data is secure?

The security and privacy of your data is the biggest consideration in 
everything we do since you are placing your trust in our service. We 
want you to know that we've implemented security standards and 
operational processes using industry standards to protect your data.

Logit.io uses HTTPS for all services using TLS (SSL) 
on our public website and the platform.

Data is transmitted securely from your system to Logit.io using 
Transport Layer Security (TLS). We offer a range of endpoints, 
giving you the choice of the protocol used.

All data is encrypted at rest with AES-256, and keys are rotated 
and monitored continuously. All of your logging and metrics data 
is permanently deleted at the end of your retention period 
or on the deletion of a stack.

To get access to your data, your team may log in to our secure 
web application through HTTPS. Users access their data through 
secure sessions encrypted using TLS.

Service Provider compliant and operates in compliance with SOC-2,
