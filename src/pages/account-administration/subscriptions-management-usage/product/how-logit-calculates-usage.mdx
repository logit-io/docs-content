# How Logit.io calculates daily index sizes and used volume statistics

## Why is the index size sometimes less than that reported in Stack usage Statistics?

Logs Sent is calculated from the maximum amount of disk utilised 
by OpenSearch for a particular day, for the primary data store.

It's important to be aware that when viewing the Elasticsearch index 
status (using `/_cat/indices`) this page reports by default in [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte)
and Logit reports usage in the more commonly used Gigabyte [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte), 
hence a difference when trying to compare the values.

You can always query the elasticsearch index api and return the 
`pri.store.size` in bytes `/_cat/indices?h=index,pri.store.size&bytes=b&v`, 
which can then be converted into GB's.

## Are the elastalert_status indexes included in the daily usage statistics?

The elastalert_status indexes aren't included in the usage statistics and the 
cut of time for index size calculation is UTC 00:00. Indexes that are currently 
in use are normally slightly larger in size than older indexes, 
this is due to older indexes being compressed.
