# If we update a stack to the latest version, will we lose any data?

There are two possible approaches to upgrading a stack to the latest version:

## Option 1

The first, simplest option is to create a new stack in the latest available 
version and then set up your data feeds to use the new stack before deleting the old stack.

## Option 2

The second option is to request an in-place upgrade to the latest version 
where the existing stack ID is retained and the data is migrated by Logit 
into the upgraded stack.

With the first option, because it is a brand new stack, there is no need to 
migrate data and therefore no risk of data loss. With the second option, 
there is a very low risk of data loss (we haven't had any cases of data loss 
to date) but we can't 100% guarantee data will be restored back 
into your Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster.
