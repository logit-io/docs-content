# How to disable Two Factor Authentication for your Logit.io account

Log into your account and navigate to [Your profile](https://dashboard.logit.io/profile). On your profile page, there is a section called "Security", this is where Two Factor Authentication can be disabled.

Click the "Disable 2FA" button and you will be asked to select your account and then authenticate with Google Authenticator or a similar app that you have previously chosen. You will then be returned to your Logit.io profile page.

You can confirm that Two Factor Authentication has been disabled when you return to the Profile page because the message in the "Security" section has been updated accordingly.
