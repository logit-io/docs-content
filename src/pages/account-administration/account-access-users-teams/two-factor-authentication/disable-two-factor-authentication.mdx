Click the "Disable 2FA" button. If have more than one user account you will be asked to select your account, otherwise you will be taken straight to the page to enter your code. Authenticate with Google Authenticator or a similar app that 
you have previously chosen. You will then be returned to your Logit.io profile page.

You can confirm that Two Factor Authentication has been disabled when you return to the Profile page because the message in the "Multi-Factor Authentication" section has been updated accordingly.
