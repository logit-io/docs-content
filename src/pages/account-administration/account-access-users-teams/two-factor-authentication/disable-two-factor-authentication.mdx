# How to disable Two Factor Authentication for your Logit.io account

Log into Logit.io and navigate to [Your profile](https://dashboard.logit.io/profile). On your profile page, there is a section called __Multi-Factor Authentication__, this is where Two Factor Authentication can be disabled.

Click the __Disable 2FA__ button. If you have more than one user account you will be asked to select your account, otherwise you will be taken straight to the page to enter your code. Authenticate with Google Authenticator or a similar app that 
you have previously chosen. You will then be returned to your Logit.io profile page.

You can confirm that Two Factor Authentication has been disabled when you return to the Profile page because the message in the __Multi-Factor Authentication__ section has been updated accordingly.
