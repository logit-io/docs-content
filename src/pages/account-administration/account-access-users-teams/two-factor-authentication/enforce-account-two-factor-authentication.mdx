As well as being able

all account users to enable Two-Factor Authentication before accessing the account.

 __Note__: In order to force two-factor authentication for an Account you must be a User who can manage User Access on the Account.

 To enforce two-factor authentication on an account go to __Account Settings__ and then select __Multi-Factor Auth__ as shown in the image below.
