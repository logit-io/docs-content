# Enable Two Factor Authentication for your Logit.io account

Two Factor Authentication, also known as 2FA, adds an extra layer of security for 
you when you are signing into the Logit.io platform. As well as using your chosen 
authentication provider, you will also need an additional code or to grant permission 
from a device that only you have access to. Requiring more than one piece of 
identifying information helps to increase the security of your Logit.io account.

### Enabling 2FA for your Logit.io account

Login to your account and navigate to [your profile](https://dashboard.logit.io/settings/profile). 
Here you will find a section titled "Security".
