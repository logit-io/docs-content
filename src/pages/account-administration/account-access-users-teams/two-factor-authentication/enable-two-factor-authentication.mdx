# Enable Two-Factor Authentication for your Logit.io account

Two-Factor Authentication, also known as 2FA, adds an extra layer of security for 
you when you are signing into the Logit.io platform. As well as using your chosen 
authentication provider, you will also need an additional code or to grant permission 
from a device that only you have access to. Requiring more than one piece of 
identifying information helps to increase the security of your Logit.io user.

### Enabling 2FA for your Logit.io account

Login to Logitio and navigate to [your profile](https://dashboard.logit.io/settings/profile). 
Here you will find a section titled __Multi-Factor Authentication__.

Click the __Enable Two-Factor Authentication__ button. If you have more than one user account you will be taken to the 
sign-in screen, from here select your account to authenticate. Otherwise you will be taken straight to the QR code.
