# Using Google Authenticator for Two Factor Authentication with your Logit.io account

Google Authenticator or similar apps can be found in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_GB).

First, you will need 
to [enable two-factor authentication](/account-administration/account-access-users-teams/two-factor-authentication/enable-two-factor-authentication) for your Logit.io user.
When enabling 2FA using Google Authenticator (or similar) you will be 
presented with a barcode and a field to enter a passcode. 
You need to scan the barcode to retrieve the passcode.

Your device screen will show the camera view with a crosshair, 
aim the device so that the barcode presented is within this box.

Once the barcode has been scanned, your Logit.io account will be added to Google 
Authenticator with an associated six-digit code. Enter this code into the passcode 
field and click to continue. You will now be returned to your Logit.io profile page.
