# How do I enable OKTA SSO (Single Sign-On) for my Logit.io account?

### What is OKTA SSO (Single Sign-On?)

OKTA SSO allows a user to authenticate in OKTA and then be able to seamlessly sign into Logit.io. With OKTA settings added to your Logit.io account, 
it means your users will have a seamless experience where they can sign in once and will have access to your own products and applications as well as 
Logit.io too. Using Logit.io with OKTA enabled will help you stay on top of the constantly growing compliance requirements such as ISO 27001, SOC2, 
GDPR, PCI & Cyber Essentials Compliance.

### Configure OKTA

You will need to sign into your OKTA account and then go to the Admin area.

From the left-side menu select Applications -> Applications and then click the **Create App Integration** button.

![Create Okta App](@/images/sso/okta/okta-create-app.png)

This will bring up the **Create a new app integration** dialog box. In the **Sign-in method** section select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and in the 
**Application type** section select **Web Application** as shown below and then click **Next**.

![Select Integration Type](@/images/sso/okta/okta-select-integration.png)

You will be redirected to the **New Web App Integration** screen. Give your new application a name to identify it e.g. **Logit.io**. 
You can download the Logo from our CDN <a href="https://cdn.logit.io/content/images/logo.png" download target="_blank">Here</a> or use the url below.

```text copy 
curl -O https://cdn.logit.io/content/images/logo.png || wget https://cdn.logit.io/content/images/logo.png
```

![Name the Integration](@/images/sso/okta/okta-name-integration.png)

Now scroll down slightly to the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field and copy and paste this sign-in redirect URL below.

```text  copy filename="Sign-in Redirect URIs" 
https://auth.logit.io/login/callback
```

![Add redirect url](@/images/sso/okta/okta-add-redirect.png)

Finally scroll down to the **Assignments** section and click **Allow everyone in you organization to access** for **Controlled access** and also de-select 
**Enable immediate access with Federation Broker Mode** for **Enable immediate access** and then click **Save**.

_Info - Clicking **Allow everyone in your organization to access** means that all users are automatically assigned to the new app without you having to do 
it for each user manually._

You will be returned to the **General** tab of the Application. From here copy the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** to somewhere as they will be 
required later.

![Get App Credentials](@/images/sso/okta/okta-credentials.png)

Scroll down to the __General Settings__ section and click "Edit".

![General Settings](@/images/sso/okta/general-settings.png)

We need to fill in the __LOGIN__ section of the __General Settings__.

We already filled in the __Sign-in redirect URIs__ when we created the app and the __Sign-out redirect URIs__ can be left as it is.

For the __Login initiated by__ property set the dropdown value to be __Either Okta or App__.

For the __Application visibility__ property, select __Display application icon to users__.

For the __Login flow__ property select __Redirect to app to initiate login (OIDC Compliant)__

The final property is __Initiate login URI__, this property will be left blank for now and Logit.io will send you this URI when configuration has been completed.

After setting the properties described above your settings should look the same as the screenshot below:

![Login Settings](@/images/sso/okta/login-settings.png)

Now save the __LOGIN__ settings.

Finally, you need your Okta Domain, if you do not know what this is you can get it by clicking on your username in the top right-hand 
corner and copy it from here as shown below. Note you will need this later.

### Send your configuration to Logt.io

Now that you have set the account up you have everything you need to contact us to set this up for you. Please email us at [support@logit.io](mailto:support@logit.io)
and include the following information:

```text copy filename="subject" /@account_id/
Request to enable Single Sign On for AccountId: @account_id
```

```text copy filename="body" /@account_id/ /@client_secret/ /@client_id/ /@domain/
Logit.io AccountId: @account_id
Okta Domain: @domain
Okta Client ID: @client_id
Okta Client Secret: @client_secret
```

The email text should be replaced with the values that you stored during the OKTA app creation process.

### Setup confirmation

Once we have configured Okta for your Logit.io Account you will receive a confirmation email and this will include your __Initiate login URI__.

You will need to sign into your OKTA account and then go to the Admin area and select the app that you created above.

This will open you in the __General__ tab. In here you will need to  scroll down to the __General Settings__ section and click "Edit".

![General Settings](@/images/sso/okta/general-settings.png)

In the __LOGIN__ section find the __Initiate login URL__ property and paste in the URI that was sent to you and then save.

![Initiate Login URI](@/images/sso/okta/initiate-login-uri.png)

Now when you click on the Logit.io app in the __My Apps__ area of Okta you will be launched straight into the Logit.io website without needing to Authenticate again.
