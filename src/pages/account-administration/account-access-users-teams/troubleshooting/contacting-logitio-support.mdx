# Preferred methods of contacting Logit.io support

To streamline your support experience, we recommend 
utilizing <IntercomButton text="Logit.io's live chat " /> feature, 
which not only provides real-time access to our support team but 
also automatically generates a support ticket for your request, 
ensuring prompt assistance and efficient issue tracking.

This convenient option is ideal for resolving urgent matters and 
seeking guidance with Logit.io's dedicated support professionals.

In addition to the live chat option, we also welcome inquiries made 
through our [contact form](https://logit.io/about-us/contact-us/) or by 
email to support@logit.io. We understand that every user has their preferred 
method of reaching out, and the contact form provides a flexible alternative 
for those who may not be available for an immediate chat.

When you choose to use our contact form, you'll have the opportunity to 
submit a comprehensive request or question at your own pace, allowing you 
to include all the necessary details related to your issue or inquiry.

You can rest assured that our dedicated support team will review and 
respond to all inquiries submitted through the contact form 
or <IntercomButton text="via live chat" /> in a timely manner.
