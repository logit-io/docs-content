# I'm getting access denied errors when logging in with Azure AD

If you experience 'access denied' errors when logging in to Logit.io via your Azure AD credentials, there could be a number of reasons why this error message is displayed. However, it is likely that this needs to be resolved by the Administrator of the Azure account you are the user of. Advice on how to resolve two common errors are outlined below.

### Instructions for the Account Administrator

### Error 1- Generic Access denied

The user will see the 'Need admin approval' message and also receive an 'Access denied' message when trying to return to the application without granting consent.

To resolve this problem, the Azure AD administrator needs to update the User settings, they can do this by clicking on 'Enterprise Applications' in the left-hand side Manage menu, and then clicking on 'User settings.'

Under the Enterprise applications section, the 'Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf' option needs to be set to Yes.

### â€‹Error 2 -The user is not assigned to a role for the application

The user will see the following 'Access denied' error message.
