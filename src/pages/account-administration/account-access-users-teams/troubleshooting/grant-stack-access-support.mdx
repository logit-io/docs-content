# Grant Stack Access for Support

## Why Grant Account Access?

It's possible that whilst you're working with the Logit.io platform that 
you may run into some issues or difficulties. Whilst the majority of these 
issues are answered in our thorough help centre, there are some instances 
where we may need to access your stack to assist. Therefore, granting us 
access to your stack will allow us to diagnose and resolve the customer 
support issue that you raised.

## Working with Support Access

In order to locate 'Support Access', first navigate to the menu on the 
far left of your screen, you will see a section labeled 'Help and Support', 
select this. Now you're at the 'Help and Support' page, select 'Support Access' 
from the menu on the left, underneath 'Live Chat.' This will take you to 
the 'Support Access' page. (see image below).

Here, you can easily grant our team access to any of your stacks or your entire 
account in order to rectify any issues that you may have raised through customer 
support. Our access will automatically expire after 7 days or you 
can revoke access sooner if you prefer.
