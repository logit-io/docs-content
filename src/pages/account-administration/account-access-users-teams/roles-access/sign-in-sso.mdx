# How to Sign In via Single Sign On

### What is SSO (Single Sign-On?)

SSO allows a user to authenticate in one central location and then be able to seamlessly sign into other applications automatically. Logit.io supports a wide range of Federated Identity options including, GSuite, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), AD (Active Directory), and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).

### To sign into Logit.io with SSO from the Login Screen:

Go to [https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-in](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-in), enter your company email address, and click “next"
