# Managing OpenSearch & Grafana Security Roles

### OpenSearch Roles Introduction

OpenSearch Security Roles gives you more granular control of user access to your Stacks. Roles allow you to specify cluster permissions, index permissions, document and field-level security. By mapping users to roles, users gain access based on those permissions.

<Callout type="info">
  OpenSearch security roles requires a Logit.io Stack running Opendistro 1.13 onwards.
</Callout>

By default all Logit.io Teams come with the roles shown below for common scenarios, to modify the roles for a team choose Account Settings > Team Settings from your dashboard. You can add a new team or edit an existing team to modify the roles.

When you add or update a team the roles are automatically synchronised to OpenSearch Security for you, removing the need for the manual mapping of users to roles in OpenSearch. You can read more details below about what permissions each predefined role grants to members of that team.

### Stack Administrator

Users assigned to this role can manage all aspects of existing stacks.

### OpenSearch Custom Role

Users assigned to this role can view the OpenSearch instance but permissions are based on any custom roles defined in the Security Roles section of OpenSearch. Use this role if you want to give the members access to specific custom roles that you have defined directly in OpenSearch e.g. granting them specific index level permissions.
