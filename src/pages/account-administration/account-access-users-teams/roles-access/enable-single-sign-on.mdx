# How do I enable SSO (Single Sign-On) for my Logit.io account?

### What is SSO (Single Sign-On?)

SSO allows a user to authenticate in one central location and then be able to seamlessly sign into other applications automatically. If your company uses Enterprise SSO, and password management with client and server components, then Logit.io can be added to your SSO accounts too. Logit.io supports a wide range of Federated Identity options including, GSuite, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), AD (Active Directory) and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).

### Why use SSO?

With your SSO settings added to your Logit.io account, it means your users will have a seamless experience where they can sign in once and will have access to your own products and applications as well as Logit.io too. Using Logit.io with SSO enabled will help you stay on top of the constantly growing compliance requirements such as ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR, PCI & Cyber Essentials Compliance.

### How can I enable SSO?

SSO is available to all customers. There is however a charge depending on the account size. If you are interested in setting up SSO with Logit.io then please speak to your sales representative or email [sales@logit.io](mailto:sales@logit.io) for more information.
