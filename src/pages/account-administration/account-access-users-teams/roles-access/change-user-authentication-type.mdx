# How to Change User or Authentication Type on Logit.io

As an existing user of Logit.io, you may need to change your user type for various reasons, such as requiring different access levels or no longer being able to use your current user type. In this article, we'll show you how to easily switch from one user type to another on Logit.io.

Step 1: Choose Manage Users from the left menu on your dashboard.

Step 2: Send an Invite to Your New Email Address.
Click the "Invite" button and enter the new email address that you want to use for your Logit.io account. 
You can also assign the required permissions at the same time. For more information on inviting and 
adding users to teams, check out the 
Logit.io [Help article on Inviting and Adding Users to Teams](/account-administration/account-access-users-teams/roles-access/inviting-users-to-your-account).

Step 3: Sign Out of Your Logit.io Session.

Step 4: Follow the invite link in the email that you received to your new email address.

Step 5: Choose Sign Up using the new username and entering a password.
This will join you to the account with the new username and password.
