# How to give a user or team access only to a specific index in OpenSearch

To grant Index Level access to users of your Stack you first need to create a 
team and configure the required OpenSearch Custom Role. This is a special role 
that gives you the flexibility to manage the users within this team by choosing 
from any available Security Roles for your Stack.

Based on your permissions you can view your teams via Account Settings > Teams. 
From here you can view existing and add new teams to your account.

### Adding an OpenSearch Custom Role Team

All Logit.io accounts have a number of predefined teams that you can use to manage 
common scenarios, in this case, we want to add a new team, so choose 'Create a new team'.

Give the team a suitable name e.g. My Custom Index Only Team.
Under "Stack Only Permission Roles" choose Manage Roles for the required Stack.

Select the "OpenSearch Custom Role" checkbox and choose the roles that you want this Custom Role to have.

<Callout type="info">
  If you have added roles in OpenSearch Security but don't see them listed here, 
  choose "Re-Sync Roles". Alternatively, if you need to add a new role then choose 
  "Create Role In OpenSearch" to open up OpenSearch Security.

Under Team Members and Access Permissions, you can choose which team members belong to this team.

Team members added to an OpenSearch Custom Role team here will automatically be 
added to the relevant role in OpenSearch Security as shown below.

In addition, if you would like to manage permissions for users directly in 
OpenSearch Security we also give you the flexibility to do this, see how to 
manage [permissions directly using OpenSearch Security](/account-administration/account-access-users-teams/roles-access/opensearch-custom-role).
