# How do I enable OKTA SSO (Single Sign-On) for my Logit.io account?

### What is OKTA SSO (Single Sign-On?)

OKTA SSO allows a user to authenticate in OKTA and then be able to seamlessly sign into Logit.io. With OKTA settings added to your Logit.io account, 
it means your users will have a seamless experience where they can sign in once and will have access to your own products and applications as well as 
Logit.io too. Using Logit.io with OKTA enabled will help you stay on top of the constantly growing compliance requirements such as ISO 27001, SOC2, 
GDPR, PCI & Cyber Essentials Compliance.

### How can I enable OKTA?

You will need to sign into your OKTA account and then go to the Admin area.

From the left-side menu select Applications -> Applications and then click the "Create App Integration" button.

![Create Okta App](@/images/sso/okta/okta-create-app.png)

This will bring up the "Create a new app integration" dialog box. In the **Sign-in method** section select "OIDC - OpenID Connect" and in the 
**Application type** section select "Web Application" as shown below and then click "Next".

![Select Integration Type](@/images/sso/okta/okta-select-integration.png)

You will be redirected to the "New Web App Integration" screen. Give your new application a name to identify it. It isn't important what you call it as 
this is not used again.

Now scroll down slightly to the "Sign-in redirect URIs" field and copy and paste this sign-in redirect URL.

```text copy
https://auth.logit.io/login/callback
```

Finally scroll down to the "Assignments" section and click "Allow everyone in you organization to access" for **Controlled access** and also de-select 
"Enable immediate access with Federation Broker Mode" for **Enable immediate access** and then click "Save".

_Info - Clicking "Allow everyone in your organization to access" means that all users are automatically assigned to the new app without you having to do 
it for each user manually._

You will be returned to the "General" tab of the Application. From here copy the "Client ID" and the  "Client Secret" to somewhere as they will be 
required later.

![Get App Credentials](@/images/sso/okta/okta-credentials.png)

Finally, you need your Okta Domain, if you do not know what this is you can get it by clicking on your username in the top right-hand 
corner and copy it from here as shown below. In this example the domain name is "trial-3094661.okta.com". You will also need this later.

Now that you have set the account up you have everything you need to contact us to set this up for you. Please email us at [support@logit.io](mailto:support@logit.io)
and include the following information:

```text copy filename="subject" /@account_id/
Please set up an Okta connection for AccountId: @account_id
```

```text copy filename="body" /@account_id/
Logit.io AccountId: @account_id
Okta Domain: Retrieved in the steps above
Okta Client ID: Retrieved in the steps above
Okta Client Secret: Retrieved in the step above
```

The "Retrieved in the steps above" text should be replaced with the values that you stored during the OKTA app creation process.
